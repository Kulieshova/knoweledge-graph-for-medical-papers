(am j psychiatry 2008; 165:342–351) p atients with major depressive disorder often also suf- fer from anxiety, nervousness, and the somatic correlatesof these states (1). in patients with high levels of anxietyaccompanying major depression, greater severity of de-pressive illness and functional impairment (2), greater ill-ness chronicity (3), and an increased risk of suicidality (4)have been reported. although dsm-iv (5) does not recognize anxious de- pression as a diagnostic subtype, emerging evidence sug-gests a number of distinguishing features for this potentialsubtype (2, 3, 6). in outpatients with major depression,earlier studies reported lifetime comorbidity rates of 40%–50% (7, 8) for anxiety disorders. more recently, in two dis-tinct large subsamples of outpatients with major depres-sion in the sequenced treatment alternatives to relievedepression (star*d) project (6, 9), the proportion withanxious depression (those having a baseline 17-itemhamilton rating scale for depression [ham-d] anxiety/somatization factor score ≥7) was in the range of 44%– 46%. in both subsamples, patients with anxious depres-sion were significantly more likely to be unemployed, tohave less education, to be more severely depressed, to have more concurrent anxiety disorders, and to reportmore melancholic/endogenous features, even after ad-justment for severity of depression. previous research has also shown that individuals expe- riencing major depressive disorder with high levels of anx-iety symptoms have a slower response to treatment (10)and, in some (11–13) but not all (4, 14) short-term studies,are less likely than those without high levels of anxious']\n",

cotherapies, including tcas [9]. furthermore, maois have demonstrated specific efficacy in treating depression with atypical features, such as reactive moods, reverse neuro-vegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection [12]. maois are also a potential therapeutic option when ect is contraindicated [13]. maois’ effectiveness is still unclear for treating depression in patients who are resistant to multiple sequential trials with ssris and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) [14]. nevertheless, psychiatrists’ use of maois has declined over the years [15,16]. the use of maois is generally restricted tokarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9352 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31who do not respond to other treatments. tcas the first tca was discovered and released for clinical use in 1957 under the brand name tofranil [5,17]. since then, tcas have remained among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide [9]. tcas-such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protrip - tyline, imipramine, desipramine, doxepin, and trimipramine-are about as effective as other classes of antidepressants-including ssris, snris, and maois-in treating major depression [18,19]. however, some tcas can be more effective than ssris when used to treat hospit- alized patients [20]. this efficacy can be explained by the superiority of tcas over ssris for patients with severe major depressive disorder (mdd) symptoms who require hospitalization [21-24]. however, no differences have been detected in outpatients who are considered less severely ill[18,20]. in most cases, tcas should generally be reserved for situations when first-line drug treatments have failed [25]. ssris in december 1987, a series of clinical studies confirmed that an ssri called fluoxetine was as effective as tcas for treating depression while causing fewer adverse effects [26]. after being released onto the market, its use expanded more quickly than that of any other psychotropic in history. in 1994, it was the second-best-selling drug in the world [7]. currently available ssris include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. they have elicited different tolerance rates and side effects-mostly sexual and digestive (nausea and loss of appetite), as well as irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches [27]. nevertheless, ssris have a good tolerability profile [28]. in most systematic reviews and meta-analyses, ssris have demonstrated comparable efficacy to tcas [18,19,29], and there is no significant evidence indicating the superiority of any other class or agent over ssris [29-31]. furthermore, studies show no differences in efficacy among individual ssris [29,31-34]. therefore, most guidelines currently recommend ssris as the first-line treatment for patients with major depression [25]. norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors other monoamine (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors called snris emerged during the 1990s to protect patients against the adverse effects of ssris [35]. currently available snris are venlafaxine, desvenla- faxine (the principal metabolite of venlafaxine), and duloxetine. the extended-release form of venlafaxine is the most commonly used drug in this class. clinical guidelines commonly recommend prescribing snri to patients who do not respond to ssris [25]. in individual studies, venlafaxine and duloxetine are generally considered effective as ssris [36]. also, venlafaxine’s efficacy is comparable to that of tcas [37,38]. according to some meta-analyses, reboxetine (a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) seems less efficacious than ssris [39]. however, these findings could be due to the relatively poor tolerance of reboxetine [40]. other antidepressants trazodone is the oldest medication of the so-called “other antidepressants” group that is still in wide use[41,42]. it has been shown to be an effective antidepressant in placebo-controlled research. however, in contemporary practice, it is much more likely to be used in low doses as a sedative-hypnotic than as an antidepressant [41,42]. nefazodone’s structure is analogous to that of trazodone, though it has different pharmacological properties [43]. its efficacy and overall tolerability are comparable to those of ssris, as indicated by comparative trials [43]. however, its use is associated with rare (but fatal) cases of clinical idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity [44]. bupropion’s mechanism of action remains unclear, though it is classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor [45]. it appears to have a more activating profile than ssris that are modestly superior to bupropion in patients with mdd [46]. however, for individuals with low to moderate levels of anxiety, the efficacy of bupropion in treating mdd is comparable to that of ssris [46]. moreover, bupropion has a better tolerability profile than ssris, with minimal weight gain (or even leading to weight loss) [46]. in addition, bupropion is more likely than some ssris to improve symptoms of fatigue and sleepinesskarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9353 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31mirtazapine and mianserin are tetracyclic compounds

bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. the main outcomes were the proportion of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. findings m irtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine (odds ratios [or] 1·39, 1·33, 1·30 and 1·27, respectively), ﬂ uoxetine (1·37, 1·32, 1·28, and 1·25, respectively), ﬂ uvoxamine (1·41, 1·35, 1·30, and 1·27, respectively), paroxetine (1·35, 1·30, 1·27, and 1·22, respectively), and reboxetine (2·03, 1·95, 1·89, and 1·85, respectively). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other antidepressants tested. escitalopram and sertraline showed the best proﬁ le of acceptability, leading to signiﬁ cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine. interpretation clinically important diﬀ erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both eﬃ cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost. funding none. introduction in the past 20 years, several new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of depression, many of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. as with statins for the prevention of coronary events, 1 the extent to which these agents vary in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability is unclear. moreover, some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs 2—ie, chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather than genuine advances in treatment. systematic reviews have already highlighted some diﬀ erences in eﬃ cacy between second-generation antidepressants. 3–9 we report an overview of all randomised controlled trials that compared 12 new-generation antidepressants in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. we used multiple-treat-ments meta-analysis, 10 also known as mixed-treatment comparisons meta-analysis or network meta-analysis, which allows the integration of data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how eﬀ ective they are compared with a common comparator treatment). 11 we aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can be used to guide treatment decisions. methods study selection and data collection at the beginning of this project, we drafted a study protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the public on our

calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: the analysis was based on the total number of randomly assigned participants, irrespective of how the original study investigators analysed the data. to carry out a clinically sound analysis, we used a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming that they did not respond to treatment.first, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies that compared the same interventions with a random-eﬀ ects model 18 to incorporate the assumption that diﬀ erent studies assessed diﬀ erent, yet related, treatment eﬀ ects.17 we used visual inspection of the forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, and the i 2 statistic.19 we did the analyses using stata version 9. second, we did a random-eﬀ ects model within a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo methods in winbugs (mrc biostatistics unit, cambridge, uk). 11 we modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and speciﬁ ed the relations among the odds ratios (ors) across studies making diﬀ erent comparisons. 10 this method combines direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. we used p values less than 0·05 and 95% cis (according to whether the ci included the null value) to assess signiﬁ cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence. 20 we also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most eﬃ cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the or for each drug compared with an arbitrary common control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the markov chain in which each drug had the highest or, the second highest, and so on. we ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods. a key assumption behind multiple-treatments meta- analysis is that the analysed network is coherent—ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. to estimate incoherence, we calculated the ratio of odds ratios for indirect versus direct evidence whenever indirect estimates could be constructed with a single common comparator. we deﬁ ned incoherence as the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% ci excluding 1. finally, we looked at comparative eﬃ cacy among the 12 antidepressant drugs. we expressed these using ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug, because it was the ﬁ rst among these 12 antidepressants to be marketed in europe and the usa, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair-wise comparisons. we did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic range) and imputation (including only studies without imputation). to investigate the eﬀ ect of sponsorship on outcome estimate, we carried out a meta-regression analysis. role of the funding source no drug

network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for eﬃ cacy and 41 for acceptability. we did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that eﬃ cacy favours escitalopram over citalopram; citalopram over reboxetine and paroxetine; mirtazapine over ﬂ uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over ﬂ uoxetine; and venlafaxine over ﬂ uoxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine. these results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two cis would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). for dropouts, ﬂ uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline. overall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons the 95% ci included values that showed very high or no heterogeneity, reﬂ ecting the small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. in the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found i 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine (i2=85·0%), and escitalopram and ﬂ uoxetine (i2=82·7%). in both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.figure 3 summarises the results of the multiple- treatments meta-analysis. escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (even though less clear beneﬁ ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine, with the credibility interval for or slightly more than 1). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other 11 antidepressants. these ﬁ ndings arise from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings might be expected by chance alone. in terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine were less well tolerated than escitalopram and sertraline; ﬂ uvoxamine less well tolerated than citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline; venlafaxine less well tolerated than escitalopram; reboxetine less well tolerated than many other antidepressants, such as bupropion, citalopram, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, and sertraline; and escitalopram and sertraline were better tolerated than duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine

(paroxetine–citalopram–escitalopram; ﬂ uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– ﬂ uoxetine–bupropion) and three out of 63 comparisons for dropout rate (sertraline–citalopram–escitalopram; ﬂ uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– citalopram–ﬂ uoxetine). these numbers are compatible with chance because about six signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings would be expected out of 133 statistical tests. data extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that diﬀ ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small. exclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the deﬁ ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. the multiple-treatments meta-analysis model was reﬁ tted accordingly and no diﬀ erences in conclusions were observed in either set of ors. figure 4 shows the distribution of probabilities of each treatment being ranked at each of the possible 12 positions. mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were among the most eﬃ cacious treatments, and escitalopram, sertraline, bupropion, and citalopram were better tolerated than the other remaining antidepressants (ﬁ gure 4). the cumulative probabilities of being among the four most eﬃ cacious treatments were: mirtazapine (24·4%), escitalopram (23·7%), venlafaxine

february 28, 2009 753in a meta-regression analysis to assess potential sponsorship bias, ors and ﬁ nal rankings did not substantially change. the cumulative probability of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by the marketing company, with the comparators moving up the ranking slightly. discussion our analysis was based on 117 studies including 25 928 individuals randomly assigned to 12 diﬀ erent new-generation antidepressants. our ﬁ ndings might help to choose among new-generation antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. some antidepressants diﬀ ered both statistically and clinically. in terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. in terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated than other new-generation antidepressants. these results indicate that two of the most eﬃ cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability. here, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as side-eﬀ ects, toxic eﬀ ects, discontinuation symptoms, and social functioning. however, the most important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr aline might be the best choice when starting a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because they have the best possible balance between eﬃ cacy and acceptability. we did not do a formal cost-eﬀ ectiveness analysis; however, because some new anti depressants are now oﬀ patent and available in generic form, their acquisition cost is reduced. indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram and duloxetine) are still on patent in the usa and in europe. sertraline seems to be better than escitalo pram because of its lower cost in most countries. how ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138 reboxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and duloxetine were the least eﬃ cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour able options when prescribing an acute treat ment for major depression. furthermore, in terms of acceptability, reboxetine was the least tolerated agent among the 12 anti depressants and was signiﬁ cantly less eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drugs. therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine ﬁ rst-line acute treatment for major depression. findings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment (8 weeks) of depression. clinicians need to 0·6 0·4 0·2 0probability rank of reboxetine rank of bupropion rank of

(and to what extent) treatments work within a clinically reasonable period. clinically, the assessment of eﬃ cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16–24 weeks or more might lead to wide diﬀ erences in treatment outcome. in many systematic reviews, the ability to provide valid estimates of treatment eﬀ ect is limited because trials with diﬀ erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 a systematic review of clinical-trial data140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common deﬁ nition of early response across all included studies. apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative eﬃ cacy of antidepressants in individuals with major depression employing a common deﬁ nition of acute response that includes a predeﬁ ned follow-up duration. most trials included in our analysis did not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment, and this might undermine the validity of overall ﬁ ndings. nonetheless, all studies on antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141 evidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interests on medical publications. because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this might be a source of bias. 143 some discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and those in the direct comparisons (escitalopram vs citalopram and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). these ﬁ ndings emphasise a potential advantage of this analysis that incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible sponsorship bias. however, limitations of the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ ndings. readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study publication. 144 such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ ndings. placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately assess the eﬃ cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 in both the usa and europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled studies for marketing authorisation. the selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ cacy is well recognised 146 and there is currently controversy on this topic 147 placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients with a mild form of disease. 148 although placebo-controlled trials can be eﬃ cient because they need smaller sample sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ culties in carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical trials. 149 response to placebo across antidepressant trials has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the fraction of patients responding to active medication as well. 150 the issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed trials. 150 as placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants become increasingly diﬃ cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase iii and also in pragmatic (or eﬀ ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability of the results. although the sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability of the results would, in our opinion, oﬀ set this disadvantage. furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater eﬃ cacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that oﬀ er little to patients other than increased costs. contributors ac, cb, taf, rc, and jrg conceived and designed the meta-analysis, and gs and

(ssris) remain the gold-standard treatment for depression, new antidepressants are always being developed and tested. the ultimate goal is to discover a molecule that exhibits quick effectiveness with as few side effects as possible. daniel bovet studied the structure of histamine (the causative agent in allergic responses) to find an antagonist, which was finally synthesized in 1937 [4]. since then, many researchers have studied the link between the structures and activities of different antihistaminic agents, contributing to the discovery of almost all antide- pressants [5]. in the following subsections, we list the main classes of antidepressants in chrono- logical order of apparition, highlighting the most widely used molecules in daily psychiatric practice. monoamine oxidase inhibitors iproniazid was the first drug defined as an antidepressant; it was later classified as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) [6,7]. several other maois have been introduced since 1957 [8]. due to their irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase, moais have numerous side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and hypertensive crises, that can lead to lethal intracranial hemorrhages. consequently, maois have become less commonly used over time [9]. trials have demonstrated that maois’ efficacy is comparable to that of tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) [10,11]. however, considering maois’ drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and potentially dangerous side effects, they are now almost exclusively prescribed for patients who have not responded to several other pharma- cotherapies, including tcas [9]. furthermore, maois have demonstrated specific efficacy in treating depression with atypical features, such as reactive moods, reverse neuro-vegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection [12]. maois are also a potential therapeutic option when ect is contraindicated [13]. maois’ effectiveness is still unclear for treating depression in patients who are resistant to multiple sequential trials with ssris and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) [14]. nevertheless, psychiatrists’ use of maois has declined over the years [15,16]. the use of maois is generally restricted tokarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9352 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31who do not respond to other treatments. tcas the first tca was discovered and released for clinical use in 1957 under the brand name tofranil [5,17]. since then, tcas have remained among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide [9]. tcas-such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protrip - tyline, imipramine, desipramine, doxepin, and trimipramine-are about as effective as other classes of antidepressants-including ssris, snris, and maois-in treating major depression [18,19]. however, some tcas can be more effective than ssris when used to treat hospit- alized patients [20]. this efficacy can be explained by the superiority of tcas over ssris for patients with severe major depressive disorder (mdd) symptoms who require hospitalization [21-24]. however, no differences have been detected in outpatients who are considered less severely ill[18,20]. in most cases, tcas should generally be reserved for situations when first-line drug treatments have failed [25]. ssris in december 1987, a series of clinical studies confirmed that an ssri called fluoxetine was as effective as tcas for treating depression while causing fewer adverse effects [26]. after being released onto the market, its use expanded more quickly than that of any other psychotropic in history. in 1994, it was the second-best-selling drug in the world [7]. currently available ssris include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. they have elicited different tolerance rates and side effects-mostly sexual and digestive (nausea and loss of appetite), as well as irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches [27]. nevertheless, ssris have a good tolerability profile [28]. in most systematic reviews and meta-analyses, ssris have demonstrated comparable efficacy to tcas [18,19,29], and there is no significant evidence indicating the superiority of any other class or agent over ssris [29-31]. furthermore, studies show no differences in efficacy among individual ssris [29,31-34]. therefore, most guidelines currently recommend ssris as the first-line treatment for patients with major depression [25]. norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors other monoamine (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors called snris emerged during the 1990s to protect patients against the adverse effects of ssris [35]. currently available snris are venlafaxine, desvenla- faxine (the principal metabolite of venlafaxine), and duloxetine. the extended-release form of venlafaxine is the most commonly used drug in this class. clinical guidelines commonly recommend prescribing snri to patients who do not respond to ssris [25]. in individual studies, venlafaxine and duloxetine are generally considered effective as ssris [36]. also, venlafaxine’s efficacy is comparable to that of tcas [37,38]. according to some meta-analyses, reboxetine (a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) seems less efficacious than ssris [39]. however, these findings could be due to the relatively poor tolerance of reboxetine [40]. other antidepressants trazodone is the oldest medication of the so-called “other antidepressants” group that is still in wide use[41,42]. it has been shown to be an effective antidepressant in placebo-controlled research. however, in contemporary practice, it is much more likely to be used in low doses as a sedative-hypnotic than as an antidepressant [41,42]. nefazodone’s structure is analogous to that of trazodone, though it has different pharmacological properties [43]. its efficacy and overall tolerability are comparable to those of ssris, as indicated by comparative trials [43]. however, its use is associated with rare (but fatal) cases of clinical idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity [44]. bupropion’s mechanism of action remains unclear, though it is classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor [45]. it appears to have a more activating profile than ssris that are modestly superior to bupropion in patients with mdd [46]. however, for individuals with low to moderate levels of anxiety, the efficacy of bupropion in treating mdd is comparable to that of ssris [46]. moreover, bupropion has a better tolerability profile than ssris, with minimal weight gain (or even leading to weight loss) [46]. in addition, bupropion is more likely than some ssris to improve symptoms of fatigue and sleepinesskarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9353 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31mirtazapine and mianserin are tetracyclic compounds

antidepressants tested. escitalopram and sertraline showed the best proﬁ le of acceptability, leading to signiﬁ cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine. interpretation clinically important diﬀ erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both eﬃ cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost. funding none. introduction in the past 20 years, several new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of depression, many of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. as with statins for the prevention of coronary events, 1 the extent to which these agents vary in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability is unclear. moreover, some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs 2—ie, chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather than genuine advances in treatment. systematic reviews have already highlighted some diﬀ erences in eﬃ cacy between second-generation antidepressants. 3–9 we report an overview of all randomised controlled trials that compared 12 new-generation antidepressants in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. we used multiple-treat-ments meta-analysis, 10 also known as mixed-treatment comparisons meta-analysis or network meta-analysis, which allows the integration of data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how eﬀ ective they are compared with a common comparator treatment). 11 we aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can be used to guide treatment decisions. methods study selection and data collection at the beginning of this project, we drafted a study protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the public on our institutional website before carrying out the ﬁ nal analyses. furthermore, with the publication of this paper the overall data set will be in the public domain. for our analysis, we included only randomised controlled trials that compared any of the following 12 new-generation antidepressants (bupropion, citalo pram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirta- zapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertra line, and venlafaxine) as monotherapy in the acute-phase treatment of adults with unipolar major depression. we excluded placebo groups where present and randomised controlled trials of women with post-partum depres sion. 12 to identify the relevant studies, we reviewed the cochrane collaboration depression, anxiety, and neurosis review group

calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: the analysis was based on the total number of randomly assigned participants, irrespective of how the original study investigators analysed the data. to carry out a clinically sound analysis, we used a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming that they did not respond to treatment.first, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies that compared the same interventions with a random-eﬀ ects model 18 to incorporate the assumption that diﬀ erent studies assessed diﬀ erent, yet related, treatment eﬀ ects.17 we used visual inspection of the forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, and the i 2 statistic.19 we did the analyses using stata version 9. second, we did a random-eﬀ ects model within a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo methods in winbugs (mrc biostatistics unit, cambridge, uk). 11 we modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and speciﬁ ed the relations among the odds ratios (ors) across studies making diﬀ erent comparisons. 10 this method combines direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. we used p values less than 0·05 and 95% cis (according to whether the ci included the null value) to assess signiﬁ cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence. 20 we also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most eﬃ cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the or for each drug compared with an arbitrary common control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the markov chain in which each drug had the highest or, the second highest, and so on. we ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods. a key assumption behind multiple-treatments meta- analysis is that the analysed network is coherent—ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. to estimate incoherence, we calculated the ratio of odds ratios for indirect versus direct evidence whenever indirect estimates could be constructed with a single common comparator. we deﬁ ned incoherence as the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% ci excluding 1. finally, we looked at comparative eﬃ cacy among the 12 antidepressant drugs. we expressed these using ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug, because it was the ﬁ rst among these 12 antidepressants to be marketed in europe and the usa, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair-wise comparisons. we did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic range) and imputation (including only studies without imputation). to investigate the eﬀ ect of sponsorship on outcome estimate, we carried out a meta-regression analysis. role of the funding source no drug

network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for eﬃ cacy and 41 for acceptability. we did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that eﬃ cacy favours escitalopram over citalopram; citalopram over reboxetine and paroxetine; mirtazapine over ﬂ uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over ﬂ uoxetine; and venlafaxine over ﬂ uoxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine. these results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two cis would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). for dropouts, ﬂ uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline. overall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons the 95% ci included values that showed very high or no heterogeneity, reﬂ ecting the small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. in the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found i 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine (i2=85·0%), and escitalopram and ﬂ uoxetine (i2=82·7%). in both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.figure 3 summarises the results of the multiple- treatments meta-analysis. escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (even though less clear beneﬁ ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine, with the credibility interval for or slightly more than 1). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other 11 antidepressants. these ﬁ ndings arise from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings might be expected by chance alone. in terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine were less well tolerated than escitalopram and

uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– citalopram–ﬂ uoxetine). these numbers are compatible with chance because about six signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings would be expected out of 133 statistical tests. data extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that diﬀ ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small. exclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the deﬁ ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. the multiple-treatments meta-analysis model was reﬁ tted accordingly and no diﬀ erences in conclusions were observed in either set of ors. figure 4 shows the distribution of probabilities of each treatment being ranked at each of the

february 28, 2009 753in a meta-regression analysis to assess potential sponsorship bias, ors and ﬁ nal rankings did not substantially change. the cumulative probability of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by the marketing company, with the comparators moving up the ranking slightly. discussion our analysis was based on 117 studies including 25 928 individuals randomly assigned to 12 diﬀ erent new-generation antidepressants. our ﬁ ndings might help to choose among new-generation antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. some antidepressants diﬀ ered both statistically and clinically. in terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. in terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated than other new-generation antidepressants. these results indicate that two of the most eﬃ cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability. here, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as side-eﬀ ects, toxic eﬀ ects, discontinuation symptoms, and social functioning. however, the most important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr aline might be the best choice when starting a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because they have the best possible balance between eﬃ cacy and acceptability. we did not do a formal cost-eﬀ ectiveness analysis; however, because some new anti depressants are now oﬀ patent and available in generic form, their acquisition cost is reduced. indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram and duloxetine) are still on patent in the usa and in europe. sertraline seems to be better than escitalo pram because of its lower cost in most countries. how ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138 reboxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and duloxetine were the least eﬃ cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour able options when prescribing an acute treat ment for major depression. furthermore, in terms of acceptability, reboxetine was the least tolerated agent among the 12 anti depressants and was signiﬁ cantly less eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drugs. therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine ﬁ rst-line acute treatment for major depression. findings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment (8 weeks) of depression. clinicians need to 0·6 0·4 0·2 0probability rank of reboxetine rank of bupropion rank of

(and to what extent) treatments work within a clinically reasonable period. clinically, the assessment of eﬃ cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16–24 weeks or more might lead to wide diﬀ erences in treatment outcome. in many systematic reviews, the ability to provide valid estimates of treatment eﬀ ect is limited because trials with diﬀ erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 a systematic review of clinical-trial data140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common deﬁ nition of early response across all included studies. apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative eﬃ cacy of antidepressants in individuals with major depression employing a common deﬁ nition of acute response that includes a predeﬁ ned follow-up duration. most trials included in our analysis did not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment, and this might undermine the validity of overall ﬁ ndings. nonetheless, all studies on antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141 evidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interests on medical publications. because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this might be a source of bias. 143 some discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and those in the direct comparisons (escitalopram vs citalopram and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). these ﬁ ndings emphasise a potential advantage of this analysis that incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible sponsorship bias. however, limitations of the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ ndings. readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study publication. 144 such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ ndings. placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately assess the eﬃ cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 in both the usa and europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled studies for marketing authorisation. the selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ cacy is well recognised 146 and there is currently controversy on this topic 147 placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients with a mild form of disease. 148 although placebo-controlled trials can be eﬃ cient because they need smaller sample sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ culties in carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical trials. 149 response to placebo across antidepressant trials has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the fraction of patients responding to active medication as well. 150 the issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed trials. 150 as placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants become increasingly diﬃ cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase iii and also in pragmatic (or eﬀ ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability of the results. although the sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability of the results would, in our opinion, oﬀ set this disadvantage. furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater eﬃ cacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that oﬀ er little to patients other than increased costs. contributors ac, cb, taf, rc, and jrg conceived and designed the meta-analysis, and gs and

inhibitors iproniazid was the first drug defined as an antidepressant; it was later classified as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) [6,7]. several other maois have been introduced since 1957 [8]. due to their irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase, moais have numerous side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and hypertensive crises, that can lead to lethal intracranial hemorrhages. consequently, maois have become less commonly used over time [9]. trials have demonstrated that maois’ efficacy is comparable to that of tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) [10,11]. however, considering maois’ drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and potentially dangerous side effects, they are now almost exclusively prescribed for patients who have not responded to several other pharma- cotherapies, including tcas [9]. furthermore, maois have demonstrated specific efficacy in treating depression with atypical features, such as reactive moods, reverse neuro-vegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection [12]. maois are also a potential therapeutic option when ect is contraindicated [13]. maois’ effectiveness is still unclear for treating depression in patients who are resistant to multiple sequential trials with ssris and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) [14]. nevertheless, psychiatrists’ use of maois has declined over the years [15,16]. the use of maois is generally restricted tokarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9352 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31who do not respond to other treatments. tcas the first tca was discovered and released for clinical use in 1957 under the brand name tofranil [5,17]. since then, tcas have remained among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide [9]. tcas-such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protrip - tyline, imipramine, desipramine, doxepin, and trimipramine-are about as effective as other classes of antidepressants-including ssris, snris, and maois-in treating major depression [18,19]. however, some tcas can be more effective than ssris when used to treat hospit- alized patients [20]. this efficacy can be explained by the superiority of tcas over ssris for patients with severe major depressive disorder (mdd) symptoms who require hospitalization [21-24]. however, no differences have been detected in outpatients who are considered less severely ill[18,20]. in most cases, tcas should generally be reserved for situations when first-line drug treatments have failed [25]. ssris in december 1987, a series of clinical studies confirmed that an ssri called fluoxetine was as effective as tcas for treating depression while causing fewer adverse effects [26]. after being released onto the market, its use expanded more quickly than that of any other psychotropic in history. in 1994, it was the second-best-selling drug in the world [7]. currently available ssris include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. they have elicited different tolerance rates and side effects-mostly sexual and digestive (nausea and loss of appetite), as well as irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches [27]. nevertheless, ssris have a good tolerability profile [28]. in most systematic reviews and meta-analyses, ssris have demonstrated comparable efficacy to tcas [18,19,29], and there is no significant evidence indicating the superiority of any other class or agent over ssris [29-31]. furthermore, studies show no differences in efficacy among individual ssris [29,31-34]. therefore, most guidelines currently recommend ssris as the first-line treatment for patients with major depression [25]. norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors other monoamine (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors called snris emerged during the 1990s to protect patients against the adverse effects of ssris [35]. currently available snris are venlafaxine, desvenla- faxine (the principal metabolite of venlafaxine), and duloxetine. the extended-release form of venlafaxine is the most commonly used drug in this class. clinical guidelines commonly recommend prescribing snri to patients who do not respond to ssris [25]. in individual studies, venlafaxine and duloxetine are generally considered effective as ssris [36]. also, venlafaxine’s efficacy is comparable to that of tcas [37,38]. according to some meta-analyses, reboxetine (a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) seems less efficacious than ssris [39]. however, these findings could be due to the relatively poor tolerance of reboxetine [40]. other antidepressants trazodone is the oldest medication of the so-called “other antidepressants” group that is still in wide use[41,42]. it has been shown to be an effective antidepressant in placebo-controlled research. however, in contemporary practice, it is much more likely to be used in low doses as a sedative-hypnotic than as an antidepressant [41,42]. nefazodone’s structure is analogous to that of trazodone, though it has different pharmacological properties [43]. its efficacy and overall tolerability are comparable to those of ssris, as indicated by comparative trials [43]. however, its use is associated with rare (but fatal) cases of clinical idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity [44]. bupropion’s mechanism of action remains unclear, though it is classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor [45]. it appears to have a more activating profile than ssris that are modestly superior to bupropion in patients with mdd [46]. however, for individuals with low to moderate levels of anxiety, the efficacy of bupropion in treating mdd is comparable to that of ssris [46]. moreover, bupropion has a better tolerability profile than ssris, with minimal weight gain (or even leading to weight loss) [46]. in addition, bupropion is more likely than some ssris to improve symptoms of fatigue and sleepinesskarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9353 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31mirtazapine and mianserin are tetracyclic compounds

bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. the main outcomes were the proportion of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. findings m irtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine (odds ratios [or] 1·39, 1·33, 1·30 and 1·27, respectively), ﬂ uoxetine (1·37, 1·32, 1·28, and 1·25, respectively), ﬂ uvoxamine (1·41, 1·35, 1·30, and 1·27, respectively), paroxetine (1·35, 1·30, 1·27, and 1·22, respectively), and reboxetine (2·03, 1·95, 1·89, and 1·85, respectively). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other antidepressants tested. escitalopram and sertraline showed the best proﬁ le of acceptability, leading to signiﬁ cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine. interpretation clinically important diﬀ erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both eﬃ cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost. funding none. introduction in the past 20 years, several new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of depression, many of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. as with statins for the prevention of coronary events, 1 the extent to which these agents vary in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability is unclear. moreover, some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs 2—ie, chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather than genuine advances in treatment. systematic reviews have already highlighted some diﬀ erences in eﬃ cacy between second-generation antidepressants. 3–9 we report an overview of all randomised controlled trials that compared 12 new-generation antidepressants in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. we used multiple-treat-ments meta-analysis, 10 also known as mixed-treatment comparisons meta-analysis or network meta-analysis, which allows the integration of data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how eﬀ ective they are compared with a common comparator treatment). 11 we aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can be used to guide treatment decisions. methods study selection and data collection at the beginning of this project, we drafted a study protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the public on our

calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: the analysis was based on the total number of randomly assigned participants, irrespective of how the original study investigators analysed the data. to carry out a clinically sound analysis, we used a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming that they did not respond to treatment.first, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies that compared the same interventions with a random-eﬀ ects model 18 to incorporate the assumption that diﬀ erent studies assessed diﬀ erent, yet related, treatment eﬀ ects.17 we used visual inspection of the forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, and the i 2 statistic.19 we did the analyses using stata version 9. second, we did a random-eﬀ ects model within a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo methods in winbugs (mrc biostatistics unit, cambridge, uk). 11 we modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and speciﬁ ed the relations among the odds ratios (ors) across studies making diﬀ erent comparisons. 10 this method combines direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. we used p values less than 0·05 and 95% cis (according to whether the ci included the null value) to assess signiﬁ cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence. 20 we also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most eﬃ cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the or for each drug compared with an arbitrary common control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the markov chain in which each drug had the highest or, the second highest, and so on. we ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods. a key assumption behind multiple-treatments meta- analysis is that the analysed network is coherent—ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. to estimate incoherence, we calculated the ratio of odds ratios for indirect versus direct evidence whenever indirect estimates could be constructed with a single common comparator. we deﬁ ned incoherence as the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% ci excluding 1. finally, we looked at comparative eﬃ cacy among the 12 antidepressant drugs. we expressed these using ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug, because it was the ﬁ rst among these 12 antidepressants to be marketed in europe and the usa, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair-wise comparisons. we did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic range) and imputation (including only studies without imputation). to investigate the eﬀ ect of sponsorship on outcome estimate, we carried out a meta-regression analysis. role of the funding source no drug

network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for eﬃ cacy and 41 for acceptability. we did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that eﬃ cacy favours escitalopram over citalopram; citalopram over reboxetine and paroxetine; mirtazapine over ﬂ uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over ﬂ uoxetine; and venlafaxine over ﬂ uoxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine. these results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two cis would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). for dropouts, ﬂ uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline. overall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons the 95% ci included values that showed very high or no heterogeneity, reﬂ ecting the small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. in the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found i 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine (i2=85·0%), and escitalopram and ﬂ uoxetine (i2=82·7%). in both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.figure 3 summarises the results of the multiple- treatments meta-analysis. escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (even though less clear beneﬁ ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine, with the credibility interval for or slightly more than 1). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other 11 antidepressants. these ﬁ ndings arise from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings might be expected by chance alone. in terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine were less well tolerated than escitalopram and sertraline; ﬂ uvoxamine less well tolerated than citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline; venlafaxine less well tolerated than escitalopram; reboxetine less well tolerated than many other antidepressants, such as bupropion, citalopram, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, and sertraline; and escitalopram and sertraline were better tolerated than duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine

(paroxetine–citalopram–escitalopram; ﬂ uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– ﬂ uoxetine–bupropion) and three out of 63 comparisons for dropout rate (sertraline–citalopram–escitalopram; ﬂ uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– citalopram–ﬂ uoxetine). these numbers are compatible with chance because about six signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings would be expected out of 133 statistical tests. data extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that diﬀ ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small. exclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the deﬁ ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. the multiple-treatments meta-analysis

february 28, 2009 753in a meta-regression analysis to assess potential sponsorship bias, ors and ﬁ nal rankings did not substantially change. the cumulative probability of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by the marketing company, with the comparators moving up the ranking slightly. discussion our analysis was based on 117 studies including 25 928 individuals randomly assigned to 12 diﬀ erent new-generation antidepressants. our ﬁ ndings might help to choose among new-generation antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. some antidepressants diﬀ ered both statistically and clinically. in terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. in terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated than other new-generation antidepressants. these results indicate that two of the most eﬃ cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability. here, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as side-eﬀ ects, toxic eﬀ ects, discontinuation symptoms, and social functioning. however, the most important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr aline might be the best choice when starting a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because they have the best possible balance between eﬃ cacy and acceptability. we did not do a formal cost-eﬀ ectiveness analysis; however, because some new anti depressants are now oﬀ patent and available in generic form, their acquisition cost is reduced. indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram and duloxetine) are still on patent in the usa and in europe. sertraline seems to be better than escitalo pram because of its lower cost in most countries. how ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138 reboxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and duloxetine were the least eﬃ cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour able options when prescribing an acute treat ment for major depression. furthermore, in terms of acceptability, reboxetine was the least tolerated agent among the 12 anti depressants and was signiﬁ cantly less eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drugs. therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine ﬁ rst-line acute treatment for major depression. findings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment (8 weeks) of depression. clinicians need to 0·6 0·4 0·2 0probability rank of reboxetine rank of bupropion rank of

(and to what extent) treatments work within a clinically reasonable period. clinically, the assessment of eﬃ cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16–24 weeks or more might lead to wide diﬀ erences in treatment outcome. in many systematic reviews, the ability to provide valid estimates of treatment eﬀ ect is limited because trials with diﬀ erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 a systematic review of clinical-trial data140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common deﬁ nition of early response across all included studies. apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative eﬃ cacy of antidepressants in individuals with major depression employing a common deﬁ nition of acute response that includes a predeﬁ ned follow-up duration. most trials included in our analysis did not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment, and this might undermine the validity of overall ﬁ ndings. nonetheless, all studies on antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141 evidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interests on medical publications. because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this might be a source of bias. 143 some discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and those in the direct comparisons (escitalopram vs citalopram and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). these ﬁ ndings emphasise a potential advantage of this analysis that incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible sponsorship bias. however, limitations of the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ ndings. readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study publication. 144 such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ ndings. placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately assess the eﬃ cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 in both the usa and europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled studies for marketing authorisation. the selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ cacy is well recognised 146 and there is currently controversy on this topic 147 placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients with a mild form of disease. 148 although placebo-controlled trials can be eﬃ cient because they need smaller sample sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ culties in carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical trials. 149 response to placebo across antidepressant trials has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the fraction of patients responding to active medication as well. 150 the issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed trials. 150 as placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants become increasingly diﬃ cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase iii and also in pragmatic (or eﬀ ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability of the results. although the sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability of the results would, in our opinion, oﬀ set this disadvantage. furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater eﬃ cacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that oﬀ er little to patients other than increased costs. contributors ac, cb, taf, rc, and jrg conceived and designed the meta-analysis, and gs and

(ssris) remain the gold-standard treatment for depression, new antidepressants are always being developed and tested. the ultimate goal is to discover a molecule that exhibits quick effectiveness with as few side effects as possible. daniel bovet studied the structure of histamine (the causative agent in allergic responses) to find an antagonist, which was finally synthesized in 1937 [4]. since then, many researchers have studied the link between the structures and activities of different antihistaminic agents, contributing to the discovery of almost all antide- pressants [5]. in the following subsections, we list the main classes of antidepressants in chrono- logical order of apparition, highlighting the most widely used molecules in daily psychiatric practice. monoamine oxidase inhibitors iproniazid was the first drug defined as an antidepressant; it was later classified as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) [6,7]. several other maois have been introduced since 1957 [8]. due to their irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase, moais have numerous side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and hypertensive crises, that can lead to lethal intracranial hemorrhages. consequently, maois have become less commonly used over time [9]. trials have demonstrated that maois’ efficacy is comparable to that of tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) [10,11]. however, considering maois’ drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and potentially dangerous side effects, they are now almost exclusively prescribed for patients who have not responded to several other pharma- cotherapies, including tcas [9]. furthermore, maois have demonstrated specific efficacy in treating depression with atypical features, such as reactive moods, reverse neuro-vegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection [12]. maois are also a potential therapeutic option when ect is contraindicated [13]. maois’ effectiveness is still unclear for treating depression in patients who are resistant to multiple sequential trials with ssris and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) [14]. nevertheless, psychiatrists’ use of maois has declined over the years [15,16]. the use of maois is generally restricted tokarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9352 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31who do not respond to other treatments. tcas the first tca was discovered and released for clinical use in 1957 under the brand name tofranil [5,17]. since then, tcas have remained among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide [9]. tcas-such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protrip - tyline, imipramine, desipramine, doxepin, and trimipramine-are about as effective as other classes of antidepressants-including ssris, snris, and maois-in treating major depression [18,19]. however, some tcas can be more effective than ssris when used to treat hospit- alized patients [20]. this efficacy can be explained by the superiority of tcas over ssris for patients with severe major depressive disorder (mdd) symptoms who require hospitalization [21-24]. however, no differences have been detected in outpatients who are considered less severely ill[18,20]. in most cases, tcas should generally be reserved for situations when first-line drug treatments have failed [25]. ssris in december 1987, a series of clinical studies confirmed that an ssri called fluoxetine was as effective as tcas for treating depression while causing fewer adverse effects [26]. after being released onto the market, its use expanded more quickly than that of any other psychotropic in history. in 1994, it was the second-best-selling drug in the world [7]. currently available ssris include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. they have elicited different tolerance rates and side effects-mostly sexual and digestive (nausea and loss of appetite), as well as irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches [27]. nevertheless, ssris have a good tolerability profile [28]. in most systematic reviews and meta-analyses, ssris have demonstrated comparable efficacy to tcas [18,19,29], and there is no significant evidence indicating the superiority of any other class or agent over ssris [29-31]. furthermore, studies show no differences in efficacy among individual ssris [29,31-34]. therefore, most guidelines currently recommend ssris as the first-line treatment for patients with major depression [25]. norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors other monoamine (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors called snris emerged during the 1990s to protect patients against the adverse effects of ssris [35]. currently available snris are venlafaxine, desvenla- faxine (the principal metabolite of venlafaxine), and duloxetine. the extended-release form of venlafaxine is the most commonly used drug in this class. clinical guidelines commonly recommend prescribing snri to patients who do not respond to ssris [25]. in individual studies, venlafaxine and duloxetine are generally considered effective as ssris [36]. also, venlafaxine’s efficacy is comparable to that of tcas [37,38]. according to some meta-analyses, reboxetine (a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) seems less efficacious than ssris [39]. however, these findings could be due to the relatively poor tolerance of reboxetine [40]. other antidepressants trazodone is the oldest medication of the so-called “other antidepressants” group that is still in wide use[41,42]. it has been shown to be an effective antidepressant in placebo-controlled research. however, in contemporary practice, it is much more likely to be used in low doses as a sedative-hypnotic than as an antidepressant [41,42]. nefazodone’s structure is analogous to that of trazodone, though it has different pharmacological properties [43]. its efficacy and overall tolerability are comparable to those of ssris, as indicated by comparative trials [43]. however, its use is associated with rare (but fatal) cases of clinical idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity [44]. bupropion’s mechanism of action remains unclear, though it is classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor [45]. it appears to have a more activating profile than ssris that are modestly superior to bupropion in patients with mdd [46]. however, for individuals with low to moderate levels of anxiety, the efficacy of bupropion in treating mdd is comparable to that of ssris [46]. moreover, bupropion has a better tolerability profile than ssris, with minimal weight gain (or even leading to weight loss) [46]. in addition, bupropion is more likely than some ssris to improve symptoms of fatigue and sleepinesskarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9353 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31mirtazapine and mianserin are tetracyclic compounds

respectively), paroxetine (1·35, 1·30, 1·27, and 1·22, respectively), and reboxetine (2·03, 1·95, 1·89, and 1·85, respectively). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other antidepressants tested. escitalopram and sertraline showed the best proﬁ le of acceptability, leading to signiﬁ cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine. interpretation clinically important diﬀ erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both eﬃ cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost. funding none. introduction in the past 20 years, several new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of depression, many of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. as with statins for the prevention of coronary events, 1 the extent to which these agents vary in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability is unclear. moreover, some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs 2—ie, chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather than genuine advances in treatment. systematic reviews have already highlighted some diﬀ erences in eﬃ cacy between second-generation antidepressants. 3–9 we report an overview of all randomised controlled trials that compared 12 new-generation antidepressants in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. we used multiple-treat-ments meta-analysis, 10 also known as mixed-treatment comparisons meta-analysis or network meta-analysis, which allows the integration of data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how eﬀ ective they are compared with a common comparator treatment). 11 we aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can be used to guide treatment decisions. methods study selection and data collection at the beginning of this project, we drafted a study protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the public on our institutional website before carrying out the ﬁ nal analyses. furthermore, with the publication of this paper the overall data set will be in the public domain. for our analysis, we included only randomised controlled trials that compared any of the following 12 new-generation antidepressants (bupropion, citalo pram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirta- zapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertra line, and venlafaxine) as monotherapy in the acute-phase treatment of adults with unipolar major depression. we excluded placebo groups where present and randomised controlled trials of women with post-partum depres sion. 12 to identify the relevant studies, we reviewed the cochrane collaboration depression, anxiety, and neurosis review group

calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: the analysis was based on the total number of randomly assigned participants, irrespective of how the original study investigators analysed the data. to carry out a clinically sound analysis, we used a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming that they did not respond to treatment.first, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies that compared the same interventions with a random-eﬀ ects model 18 to incorporate the assumption that diﬀ erent studies assessed diﬀ erent, yet related, treatment eﬀ ects.17 we used visual inspection of the forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, and the i 2 statistic.19 we did the analyses using stata version 9. second, we did a random-eﬀ ects model within a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo methods in winbugs (mrc biostatistics unit, cambridge, uk). 11 we modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and speciﬁ ed the relations among the odds ratios (ors) across studies making diﬀ erent comparisons. 10 this method combines direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. we used p values less than 0·05 and 95% cis (according to whether the ci included the null value) to assess signiﬁ cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence. 20 we also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most eﬃ cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the or for each drug compared with an arbitrary common control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the markov chain in which each drug had the highest or, the second highest, and so on. we ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods. a key assumption behind multiple-treatments meta- analysis is that the analysed network is coherent—ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. to estimate incoherence, we calculated the ratio of odds ratios for indirect versus direct evidence whenever indirect estimates could be constructed with a single common comparator. we deﬁ ned incoherence as the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% ci excluding 1. finally, we looked at comparative eﬃ cacy among the 12 antidepressant drugs. we expressed these using ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug, because it was the ﬁ rst among these 12 antidepressants to be marketed in europe and the usa, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair-wise comparisons. we did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic range) and imputation (including only studies without imputation). to investigate the eﬀ ect of sponsorship on outcome estimate, we carried out a meta-regression analysis. role of the funding source no drug

network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for eﬃ cacy and 41 for acceptability. we did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that eﬃ cacy favours escitalopram over citalopram; citalopram over reboxetine and paroxetine; mirtazapine over ﬂ uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over ﬂ uoxetine; and venlafaxine over ﬂ uoxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine. these results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two cis would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). for dropouts, ﬂ uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline. overall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons the 95% ci included values that showed very high or no heterogeneity, reﬂ ecting the small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. in the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found i 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine (i2=85·0%), and escitalopram and ﬂ uoxetine (i2=82·7%). in both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.figure 3 summarises the results of the multiple- treatments meta-analysis. escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (even though less clear beneﬁ ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine, with the credibility interval for or slightly more than 1). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other 11 antidepressants. these ﬁ ndings arise from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings might be expected by chance alone. in terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine were less well tolerated than escitalopram and

uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– citalopram–ﬂ uoxetine). these numbers are compatible with chance because about six signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings would be expected out of 133 statistical tests. data extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that diﬀ ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small. exclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the deﬁ ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. the multiple-treatments meta-analysis model was reﬁ tted accordingly and no diﬀ erences in conclusions were observed in either set of ors. figure 4 shows the distribution of probabilities of each treatment being ranked at each of the

february 28, 2009 753in a meta-regression analysis to assess potential sponsorship bias, ors and ﬁ nal rankings did not substantially change. the cumulative probability of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by the marketing company, with the comparators moving up the ranking slightly. discussion our analysis was based on 117 studies including 25 928 individuals randomly assigned to 12 diﬀ erent new-generation antidepressants. our ﬁ ndings might help to choose among new-generation antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. some antidepressants diﬀ ered both statistically and clinically. in terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. in terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated than other new-generation antidepressants. these results indicate that two of the most eﬃ cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability. here, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as side-eﬀ ects, toxic eﬀ ects, discontinuation symptoms, and social functioning. however, the most important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr aline might be the best choice when starting a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because they have the best possible balance between eﬃ cacy and acceptability. we did not do a formal cost-eﬀ ectiveness analysis; however, because some new anti depressants are now oﬀ patent and available in generic form, their acquisition cost is reduced. indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram and duloxetine) are still on patent in the usa and in europe. sertraline seems to be better than escitalo pram because of its lower cost in most countries. how ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138 reboxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and duloxetine were the least eﬃ cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour able options when prescribing an acute treat ment for major depression. furthermore, in terms of acceptability, reboxetine was the least tolerated agent among the 12 anti depressants and was signiﬁ cantly less eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drugs. therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine ﬁ rst-line acute treatment for major depression. findings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment (8 weeks) of depression. clinicians need to 0·6 0·4 0·2 0probability rank of reboxetine rank of bupropion rank of

(and to what extent) treatments work within a clinically reasonable period. clinically, the assessment of eﬃ cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16–24 weeks or more might lead to wide diﬀ erences in treatment outcome. in many systematic reviews, the ability to provide valid estimates of treatment eﬀ ect is limited because trials with diﬀ erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 a systematic review of clinical-trial data140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common deﬁ nition of early response across all included studies. apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative eﬃ cacy of antidepressants in individuals with major depression employing a common deﬁ nition of acute response that includes a predeﬁ ned follow-up duration. most trials included in our analysis did not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment, and this might undermine the validity of overall ﬁ ndings. nonetheless, all studies on antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141 evidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interests on medical publications. because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this might be a source of bias. 143 some discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and those in the direct comparisons (escitalopram vs citalopram and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). these ﬁ ndings emphasise a potential advantage of this analysis that incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible sponsorship bias. however, limitations of the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ ndings. readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study publication. 144 such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ ndings. placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately assess the eﬃ cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 in both the usa and europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled studies for marketing authorisation. the selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ cacy is well recognised 146 and there is currently controversy on this topic 147 placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients with a mild form of disease. 148 although placebo-controlled trials can be eﬃ cient because they need smaller sample sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ culties in carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical trials. 149 response to placebo across antidepressant trials has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the fraction of patients responding to active medication as well. 150 the issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed trials. 150 as placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants become increasingly diﬃ cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase iii and also in pragmatic (or eﬀ ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability of the results. although the sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability of the results would, in our opinion, oﬀ set this disadvantage. furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater eﬃ cacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that oﬀ er little to patients other than increased costs. contributors ac, cb, taf, rc, and jrg conceived and designed the meta-analysis, and gs and jpth provided supervision. ac, cb, an, taf, imo, nw, and hm identiﬁ ed and acquired reports of trials, and extracted data. ac, an, imo, nw, and hm contacted authors of trials and pharmaceutical industries for additional information. ac, cb, taf, jrg, gs, and jpth analysed and interpreted the data. gs and jpth provided statistical advice and input. rc, an, imo, nw, mt, and hm contributed to the interpretation of the data. ac drafted the manuscript. cb, jrg, taf, gs, jpth, and mt critically reviewed the manuscript. conﬂ ict of interest statement jrg has received research funding from glaxosmithkline, sanoﬁ -aventis, the uk department of health and medical research council, the stanley medical research institute, and advisory committee payments from bristol myers squibb. taf has

(am j psychiatry 2008; 165:342–351) p atients with major depressive disorder often also suf- fer from anxiety, nervousness, and the somatic correlatesof these states (1). in patients with high levels of anxietyaccompanying major depression, greater severity of de-pressive illness and functional impairment (2), greater ill-ness chronicity (3), and an increased risk of suicidality (4)have been reported. although dsm-iv (5) does not recognize anxious de- pression as a diagnostic subtype, emerging evidence sug-gests a number of distinguishing features for this potentialsubtype (2, 3, 6). in outpatients with major depression,earlier studies reported lifetime comorbidity rates of 40%–50% (7, 8) for anxiety disorders. more recently, in two dis-tinct large subsamples of outpatients with major depres-sion in the sequenced treatment alternatives to relievedepression (star*d) project (6, 9), the proportion withanxious depression (those having a baseline 17-itemhamilton rating scale for depression [ham-d] anxiety/somatization factor score ≥7) was in the range of 44%– 46%. in both subsamples, patients with anxious depres-sion were significantly more likely to be unemployed, tohave less education, to be more severely depressed, to have more concurrent anxiety disorders, and to reportmore melancholic/endogenous features, even after ad-justment for severity of depression. previous research has also shown that individuals expe- riencing major depressive disorder with high levels of anx-iety symptoms have a slower response to treatment (10)and, in some (11–13) but not all (4, 14) short-term studies,are less likely than those without high levels of anxious']\n",

(ssris) remain the gold-standard treatment for depression, new antidepressants are always being developed and tested. the ultimate goal is to discover a molecule that exhibits quick effectiveness with as few side effects as possible. daniel bovet studied the structure of histamine (the causative agent in allergic responses) to find an antagonist, which was finally synthesized in 1937 [4]. since then, many researchers have studied the link between the structures and activities of different antihistaminic agents, contributing to the discovery of almost all antide- pressants [5]. in the following subsections, we list the main classes of antidepressants in chrono- logical order of apparition, highlighting the most widely used molecules in daily psychiatric practice. monoamine oxidase inhibitors iproniazid was the first drug defined as an antidepressant; it was later classified as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) [6,7]. several other maois have been introduced since 1957 [8]. due to their irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase, moais have numerous side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and hypertensive crises, that can lead to lethal intracranial hemorrhages. consequently, maois have become less commonly used over time [9]. trials have demonstrated that maois’ efficacy is comparable to that of tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) [10,11]. however, considering maois’ drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and potentially dangerous side effects, they are now almost exclusively prescribed for patients who have not responded to several other pharma- cotherapies, including tcas [9]. furthermore, maois have demonstrated specific efficacy in treating depression with atypical features, such as reactive moods, reverse neuro-vegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection [12]. maois are also a potential therapeutic option when ect is contraindicated [13]. maois’ effectiveness is still unclear for treating depression in patients who are resistant to multiple sequential trials with ssris and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) [14]. nevertheless, psychiatrists’ use of maois has declined over the years [15,16]. the use of maois is generally restricted tokarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9352 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31who do not respond to other treatments. tcas the first tca was discovered and released for clinical use in 1957 under the brand name tofranil [5,17]. since then, tcas have remained among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide [9]. tcas-such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protrip - tyline, imipramine, desipramine, doxepin, and trimipramine-are about as effective as other classes of antidepressants-including ssris, snris, and maois-in treating major depression [18,19]. however, some tcas can be more effective than ssris when used to treat hospit- alized patients [20]. this efficacy can be explained by the superiority of tcas over ssris for patients with severe major depressive disorder (mdd) symptoms who require hospitalization [21-24]. however, no differences have been detected in outpatients who are considered less severely ill[18,20]. in most cases, tcas should generally be reserved for situations when first-line drug treatments have failed [25]. ssris in december 1987, a series of clinical studies confirmed that an ssri called fluoxetine was as effective as tcas for treating depression while causing fewer adverse effects [26]. after being released onto the market, its use expanded more quickly than that of any other psychotropic in history. in 1994, it was the second-best-selling drug in the world [7]. currently available ssris include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. they have elicited different tolerance rates and side effects-mostly sexual and digestive (nausea and loss of appetite), as well as irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches [27]. nevertheless, ssris have a good tolerability profile [28]. in most systematic reviews and meta-analyses, ssris have demonstrated comparable efficacy to tcas [18,19,29], and there is no significant evidence indicating the superiority of any other class or agent over ssris [29-31]. furthermore, studies show no differences in efficacy among individual ssris [29,31-34]. therefore, most guidelines currently recommend ssris as the first-line treatment for patients with major depression [25]. norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors other monoamine (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors called snris emerged during the 1990s to protect patients against the adverse effects of ssris [35]. currently available snris are venlafaxine, desvenla- faxine (the principal metabolite of venlafaxine), and duloxetine. the extended-release form of venlafaxine is the most commonly used drug in this class. clinical guidelines commonly recommend prescribing snri to patients who do not respond to ssris [25]. in individual studies, venlafaxine and duloxetine are generally considered effective as ssris [36]. also, venlafaxine’s efficacy is comparable to that of tcas [37,38]. according to some meta-analyses, reboxetine (a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) seems less efficacious than ssris [39]. however, these findings could be due to the relatively poor tolerance of reboxetine [40]. other antidepressants trazodone is the oldest medication of the so-called “other antidepressants” group that is still in wide use[41,42]. it has been shown to be an effective antidepressant in placebo-controlled research. however, in contemporary practice, it is much more likely to be used in low doses as a sedative-hypnotic than as an antidepressant [41,42]. nefazodone’s structure is analogous to that of trazodone, though it has different pharmacological properties [43]. its efficacy and overall tolerability are comparable to those of ssris, as indicated by comparative trials [43]. however, its use is associated with rare (but fatal) cases of clinical idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity [44]. bupropion’s mechanism of action remains unclear, though it is classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor [45]. it appears to have a more activating profile than ssris that are modestly superior to bupropion in patients with mdd [46]. however, for individuals with low to moderate levels of anxiety, the efficacy of bupropion in treating mdd is comparable to that of ssris [46]. moreover, bupropion has a better tolerability profile than ssris, with minimal weight gain (or even leading to weight loss) [46]. in addition, bupropion is more likely than some ssris to improve symptoms of fatigue and sleepinesskarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9353 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31mirtazapine and mianserin are tetracyclic compounds

bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. the main outcomes were the proportion of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. findings m irtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine (odds ratios [or] 1·39, 1·33, 1·30 and 1·27, respectively), ﬂ uoxetine (1·37, 1·32, 1·28, and 1·25, respectively), ﬂ uvoxamine (1·41, 1·35, 1·30, and 1·27, respectively), paroxetine (1·35, 1·30, 1·27, and 1·22, respectively), and reboxetine (2·03, 1·95, 1·89, and 1·85, respectively). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other antidepressants tested. escitalopram and sertraline showed the best proﬁ le of acceptability, leading to signiﬁ cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine. interpretation clinically important diﬀ erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both eﬃ cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost. funding none. introduction in the past 20 years, several new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of depression, many of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. as with statins for the prevention of coronary events, 1 the extent to which these agents vary in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability is unclear. moreover, some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs 2—ie, chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather than genuine advances in treatment. systematic reviews have already highlighted some diﬀ erences in eﬃ cacy between second-generation antidepressants. 3–9 we report an overview of all randomised controlled trials that compared 12 new-generation antidepressants in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. we used multiple-treat-ments meta-analysis, 10 also known as mixed-treatment comparisons meta-analysis or network meta-analysis, which allows the integration of data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how eﬀ ective they are compared with a common comparator treatment). 11 we aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can be used to guide treatment decisions. methods study selection and data collection at the beginning of this project, we drafted a study protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the public on our

calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: the analysis was based on the total number of randomly assigned participants, irrespective of how the original study investigators analysed the data. to carry out a clinically sound analysis, we used a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming that they did not respond to treatment.first, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies that compared the same interventions with a random-eﬀ ects model 18 to incorporate the assumption that diﬀ erent studies assessed diﬀ erent, yet related, treatment eﬀ ects.17 we used visual inspection of the forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, and the i 2 statistic.19 we did the analyses using stata version 9. second, we did a random-eﬀ ects model within a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo methods in winbugs (mrc biostatistics unit, cambridge, uk). 11 we modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and speciﬁ ed the relations among the odds ratios (ors) across studies making diﬀ erent comparisons. 10 this method combines direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. we used p values less than 0·05 and 95% cis (according to whether the ci included the null value) to assess signiﬁ cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence. 20 we also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most eﬃ cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the or for each drug compared with an arbitrary common control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the markov chain in which each drug had the highest or, the second highest, and so on. we ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods. a key assumption behind multiple-treatments meta- analysis is that the analysed network is coherent—ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. to estimate incoherence, we calculated the ratio of odds ratios for indirect versus direct evidence whenever indirect estimates could be constructed with a single common comparator. we deﬁ ned incoherence as the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% ci excluding 1. finally, we looked at comparative eﬃ cacy among the 12 antidepressant drugs. we expressed these using ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug, because it was the ﬁ rst among these 12 antidepressants to be marketed in europe and the usa, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair-wise comparisons. we did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic range) and imputation (including only studies without imputation). to investigate the eﬀ ect of sponsorship on outcome estimate, we carried out a meta-regression analysis. role of the funding source no drug

network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for eﬃ cacy and 41 for acceptability. we did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that eﬃ cacy favours escitalopram over citalopram; citalopram over reboxetine and paroxetine; mirtazapine over ﬂ uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over ﬂ uoxetine; and venlafaxine over ﬂ uoxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine. these results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two cis would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). for dropouts, ﬂ uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline. overall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons the 95% ci included values that showed very high or no heterogeneity, reﬂ ecting the small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. in the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found i 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine (i2=85·0%), and escitalopram and ﬂ uoxetine (i2=82·7%). in both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.figure 3 summarises the results of the multiple- treatments meta-analysis. escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (even though less clear beneﬁ ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine, with the credibility interval for or slightly more than 1). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other 11 antidepressants. these ﬁ ndings arise from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings might be expected by chance alone. in terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine were less well tolerated than escitalopram and sertraline; ﬂ uvoxamine less well tolerated than citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline; venlafaxine less well tolerated than escitalopram; reboxetine less well tolerated than many other antidepressants, such as bupropion, citalopram, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, and sertraline; and escitalopram and sertraline were better tolerated than duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine

uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– citalopram–ﬂ uoxetine). these numbers are compatible with chance because about six signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings would be expected out of 133 statistical tests. data extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that diﬀ ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small. exclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the deﬁ ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. the multiple-treatments meta-analysis

february 28, 2009 753in a meta-regression analysis to assess potential sponsorship bias, ors and ﬁ nal rankings did not substantially change. the cumulative probability of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by the marketing company, with the comparators moving up the ranking slightly. discussion our analysis was based on 117 studies including 25 928 individuals randomly assigned to 12 diﬀ erent new-generation antidepressants. our ﬁ ndings might help to choose among new-generation antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. some antidepressants diﬀ ered both statistically and clinically. in terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. in terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated than other new-generation antidepressants. these results indicate that two of the most eﬃ cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability. here, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as side-eﬀ ects, toxic eﬀ ects, discontinuation symptoms, and social functioning. however, the most important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr aline might be the best choice when starting a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because they have the best possible balance between eﬃ cacy and acceptability. we did not do a formal cost-eﬀ ectiveness analysis; however, because some new anti depressants are now oﬀ patent and available in generic form, their acquisition cost is reduced. indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram and duloxetine) are still on patent in the usa and in europe. sertraline seems to be better than escitalo pram because of its lower cost in most countries. how ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138 reboxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and duloxetine were the least eﬃ cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour able options when prescribing an acute treat ment for major depression. furthermore, in terms of acceptability, reboxetine was the least tolerated agent among the 12 anti depressants and was signiﬁ cantly less eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drugs. therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine ﬁ rst-line acute treatment for major depression. findings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment (8 weeks) of depression. clinicians need to 0·6 0·4 0·2 0probability rank of reboxetine rank of bupropion rank of

(and to what extent) treatments work within a clinically reasonable period. clinically, the assessment of eﬃ cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16–24 weeks or more might lead to wide diﬀ erences in treatment outcome. in many systematic reviews, the ability to provide valid estimates of treatment eﬀ ect is limited because trials with diﬀ erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 a systematic review of clinical-trial data140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common deﬁ nition of early response across all included studies. apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative eﬃ cacy of antidepressants in individuals with major depression employing a common deﬁ nition of acute response that includes a predeﬁ ned follow-up duration. most trials included in our analysis did not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment, and this might undermine the validity of overall ﬁ ndings. nonetheless, all studies on antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141 evidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interests on medical publications. because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this might be a source of bias. 143 some discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and those in the direct comparisons (escitalopram vs citalopram and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). these ﬁ ndings emphasise a potential advantage of this analysis that incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible sponsorship bias. however, limitations of the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ ndings. readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study publication. 144 such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ ndings. placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately assess the eﬃ cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 in both the usa and europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled studies for marketing authorisation. the selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ cacy is well recognised 146 and there is currently controversy on this topic 147 placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients with a mild form of disease. 148 although placebo-controlled trials can be eﬃ cient because they need smaller sample sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ culties in carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical trials. 149 response to placebo across antidepressant trials has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the fraction of patients responding to active medication as well. 150 the issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed trials. 150 as placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants become increasingly diﬃ cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase iii and also in pragmatic (or eﬀ ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability of the results. although the sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability of the results would, in our opinion, oﬀ set this disadvantage. furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater eﬃ cacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that oﬀ er little to patients other than increased costs. contributors ac, cb, taf, rc, and jrg conceived and designed the meta-analysis, and gs and

(ssris) remain the gold-standard treatment for depression, new antidepressants are always being developed and tested. the ultimate goal is to discover a molecule that exhibits quick effectiveness with as few side effects as possible. daniel bovet studied the structure of histamine (the causative agent in allergic responses) to find an antagonist, which was finally synthesized in 1937 [4]. since then, many researchers have studied the link between the structures and activities of different antihistaminic agents, contributing to the discovery of almost all antide- pressants [5]. in the following subsections, we list the main classes of antidepressants in chrono- logical order of apparition, highlighting the most widely used molecules in daily psychiatric practice. monoamine oxidase inhibitors iproniazid was the first drug defined as an antidepressant; it was later classified as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) [6,7]. several other maois have been introduced since 1957 [8]. due to their irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase, moais have numerous side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and hypertensive crises, that can lead to lethal intracranial hemorrhages. consequently, maois have become less commonly used over time [9]. trials have demonstrated that maois’ efficacy is comparable to that of tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) [10,11]. however, considering maois’ drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and potentially dangerous side effects, they are now almost exclusively prescribed for patients who have not responded to several other pharma- cotherapies, including tcas [9]. furthermore, maois have demonstrated specific efficacy in treating depression with atypical features, such as reactive moods, reverse neuro-vegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection [12]. maois are also a potential therapeutic option when ect is contraindicated [13]. maois’ effectiveness is still unclear for treating depression in patients who are resistant to multiple sequential trials with ssris and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) [14]. nevertheless, psychiatrists’ use of maois has declined over the years [15,16]. the use of maois is generally restricted tokarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9352 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31who do not respond to other treatments. tcas the first tca was discovered and released for clinical use in 1957 under the brand name tofranil [5,17]. since then, tcas have remained among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide [9]. tcas-such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protrip - tyline, imipramine, desipramine, doxepin, and trimipramine-are about as effective as other classes of antidepressants-including ssris, snris, and maois-in treating major depression [18,19]. however, some tcas can be more effective than ssris when used to treat hospit- alized patients [20]. this efficacy can be explained by the superiority of tcas over ssris for patients with severe major depressive disorder (mdd) symptoms who require hospitalization [21-24]. however, no differences have been detected in outpatients who are considered less severely ill[18,20]. in most cases, tcas should generally be reserved for situations when first-line drug treatments have failed [25]. ssris in december 1987, a series of clinical studies confirmed that an ssri called fluoxetine was as effective as tcas for treating depression while causing fewer adverse effects [26]. after being released onto the market, its use expanded more quickly than that of any other psychotropic in history. in 1994, it was the second-best-selling drug in the world [7]. currently available ssris include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. they have elicited different tolerance rates and side effects-mostly sexual and digestive (nausea and loss of appetite), as well as irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches [27]. nevertheless, ssris have a good tolerability profile [28]. in most systematic reviews and meta-analyses, ssris have demonstrated comparable efficacy to tcas [18,19,29], and there is no significant evidence indicating the superiority of any other class or agent over ssris [29-31]. furthermore, studies show no differences in efficacy among individual ssris [29,31-34]. therefore, most guidelines currently recommend ssris as the first-line treatment for patients with major depression [25]. norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors other monoamine (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors called snris emerged during the 1990s to protect patients against the adverse effects of ssris [35]. currently available snris are venlafaxine, desvenla- faxine (the principal metabolite of venlafaxine), and duloxetine. the extended-release form of venlafaxine is the most commonly used drug in this class. clinical guidelines commonly recommend prescribing snri to patients who do not respond to ssris [25]. in individual studies, venlafaxine and duloxetine are generally considered effective as ssris [36]. also, venlafaxine’s efficacy is comparable to that of tcas [37,38]. according to some meta-analyses, reboxetine (a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) seems less efficacious than ssris [39]. however, these findings could be due to the relatively poor tolerance of reboxetine [40]. other antidepressants trazodone is the oldest medication of the so-called “other antidepressants” group that is still in wide use[41,42]. it has been shown to be an effective antidepressant in placebo-controlled research. however, in contemporary practice, it is much more likely to be used in low doses as a sedative-hypnotic than as an antidepressant [41,42]. nefazodone’s structure is analogous to that of trazodone, though it has different pharmacological properties [43]. its efficacy and overall tolerability are comparable to those of ssris, as indicated by comparative trials [43]. however, its use is associated with rare (but fatal) cases of clinical idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity [44]. bupropion’s mechanism of action remains unclear, though it is classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor [45]. it appears to have a more activating profile than ssris that are modestly superior to bupropion in patients with mdd [46]. however, for individuals with low to moderate levels of anxiety, the efficacy of bupropion in treating mdd is comparable to that of ssris [46]. moreover, bupropion has a better tolerability profile than ssris, with minimal weight gain (or even leading to weight loss) [46]. in addition, bupropion is more likely than some ssris to improve symptoms of fatigue and sleepinesskarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9353 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31mirtazapine and mianserin are tetracyclic compounds

cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine (odds ratios [or] 1·39, 1·33, 1·30 and 1·27, respectively), ﬂ uoxetine (1·37, 1·32, 1·28, and 1·25, respectively), ﬂ uvoxamine (1·41, 1·35, 1·30, and 1·27, respectively), paroxetine (1·35, 1·30, 1·27, and 1·22, respectively), and reboxetine (2·03, 1·95, 1·89, and 1·85, respectively). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other antidepressants tested. escitalopram and sertraline showed the best proﬁ le of acceptability, leading to signiﬁ cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine. interpretation clinically important diﬀ erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both eﬃ cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost. funding none. introduction in the past 20 years, several new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of depression, many of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. as with statins for the prevention of coronary events, 1 the extent to which these agents vary in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability is unclear. moreover, some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs 2—ie, chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather than genuine advances in treatment. systematic reviews have already highlighted some diﬀ erences in eﬃ cacy between second-generation antidepressants. 3–9 we report an overview of all randomised controlled trials that compared 12 new-generation antidepressants in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. we used multiple-treat-ments meta-analysis, 10 also known as mixed-treatment comparisons meta-analysis or network meta-analysis, which allows the integration of data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how eﬀ ective they are compared with a common comparator treatment). 11 we aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can be used to guide treatment decisions. methods study selection and data collection at the beginning of this project, we drafted a study protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the public on our institutional website before carrying out the ﬁ nal analyses. furthermore, with the publication of this paper the overall data set will be in the public domain. for our analysis, we included only randomised controlled trials that compared any of the following 12 new-generation antidepressants (bupropion, citalo pram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirta- zapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertra line, and venlafaxine) as monotherapy in the acute-phase treatment of adults with unipolar major depression. we excluded placebo groups where present and randomised controlled trials of women with post-partum depres sion. 12 to identify the relevant studies, we reviewed the cochrane collaboration depression, anxiety, and neurosis review group

calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: the analysis was based on the total number of randomly assigned participants, irrespective of how the original study investigators analysed the data. to carry out a clinically sound analysis, we used a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming that they did not respond to treatment.first, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies that compared the same interventions with a random-eﬀ ects model 18 to incorporate the assumption that diﬀ erent studies assessed diﬀ erent, yet related, treatment eﬀ ects.17 we used visual inspection of the forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, and the i 2 statistic.19 we did the analyses using stata version 9. second, we did a random-eﬀ ects model within a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo methods in winbugs (mrc biostatistics unit, cambridge, uk). 11 we modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and speciﬁ ed the relations among the odds ratios (ors) across studies making diﬀ erent comparisons. 10 this method combines direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. we used p values less than 0·05 and 95% cis (according to whether the ci included the null value) to assess signiﬁ cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence. 20 we also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most eﬃ cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the or for each drug compared with an arbitrary common control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the markov chain in which each drug had the highest or, the second highest, and so on. we ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods. a key assumption behind multiple-treatments meta- analysis is that the analysed network is coherent—ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. to estimate incoherence, we calculated the ratio of odds ratios for indirect versus direct evidence whenever indirect estimates could be constructed with a single common comparator. we deﬁ ned incoherence as the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% ci excluding 1. finally, we looked at comparative eﬃ cacy among the 12 antidepressant drugs. we expressed these using ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug, because it was the ﬁ rst among these 12 antidepressants to be marketed in europe and the usa, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair-wise comparisons. we did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic range) and imputation (including only studies without imputation). to investigate the eﬀ ect of sponsorship on outcome estimate, we carried out a meta-regression analysis. role of the funding source no drug

network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for eﬃ cacy and 41 for acceptability. we did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that eﬃ cacy favours escitalopram over citalopram; citalopram over reboxetine and paroxetine; mirtazapine over ﬂ uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over ﬂ uoxetine; and venlafaxine over ﬂ uoxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine. these results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two cis would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). for dropouts, ﬂ uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline. overall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons the 95% ci included values that showed very high or no heterogeneity, reﬂ ecting the small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. in the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found i 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine (i2=85·0%), and escitalopram and ﬂ uoxetine (i2=82·7%). in both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.figure 3 summarises the results of the multiple- treatments meta-analysis. escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (even though less clear beneﬁ ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine, with the credibility interval for or slightly more than 1). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other 11 antidepressants. these ﬁ ndings arise from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings might be expected by chance alone. in terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine were less well tolerated than escitalopram and sertraline; ﬂ uvoxamine less well tolerated than citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline; venlafaxine less well tolerated than escitalopram; reboxetine less well tolerated than many other

uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– citalopram–ﬂ uoxetine). these numbers are compatible with chance because about six signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings would be expected out of 133 statistical tests. data extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that diﬀ ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small. exclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the deﬁ ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. the multiple-treatments meta-analysis model was reﬁ tted accordingly and no diﬀ erences in conclusions were observed in either set of ors. figure 4 shows the distribution of probabilities of each treatment being ranked at each of the possible 12 positions. mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were among the most eﬃ cacious treatments, and escitalopram, sertraline, bupropion, and citalopram were better tolerated than the other remaining antidepressants (ﬁ gure 4). the cumulative probabilities of being among the four most eﬃ cacious treatments were: mirtazapine (24·4%), escitalopram (23·7%), venlafaxine

february 28, 2009 753in a meta-regression analysis to assess potential sponsorship bias, ors and ﬁ nal rankings did not substantially change. the cumulative probability of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by the marketing company, with the comparators moving up the ranking slightly. discussion our analysis was based on 117 studies including 25 928 individuals randomly assigned to 12 diﬀ erent new-generation antidepressants. our ﬁ ndings might help to choose among new-generation antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. some antidepressants diﬀ ered both statistically and clinically. in terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. in terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated than other new-generation antidepressants. these results indicate that two of the most eﬃ cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability. here, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as side-eﬀ ects, toxic eﬀ ects, discontinuation symptoms, and social functioning. however, the most important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr aline might be the best choice when starting a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because they have the best possible balance between eﬃ cacy and acceptability. we did not do a formal cost-eﬀ ectiveness analysis; however, because some new anti depressants are now oﬀ patent and available in generic form, their acquisition cost is reduced. indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram and duloxetine) are still on patent in the usa and in europe. sertraline seems to be better than escitalo pram because of its lower cost in most countries. how ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138 reboxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and duloxetine were the least eﬃ cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour able options when prescribing an acute treat ment for major depression. furthermore, in terms of acceptability, reboxetine was the least tolerated agent among the 12 anti depressants and was signiﬁ cantly less eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drugs. therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine ﬁ rst-line acute treatment for major depression. findings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment (8 weeks) of depression. clinicians need to 0·6 0·4 0·2 0probability rank of reboxetine rank of bupropion rank of

(and to what extent) treatments work within a clinically reasonable period. clinically, the assessment of eﬃ cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16–24 weeks or more might lead to wide diﬀ erences in treatment outcome. in many systematic reviews, the ability to provide valid estimates of treatment eﬀ ect is limited because trials with diﬀ erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 a systematic review of clinical-trial data140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common deﬁ nition of early response across all included studies. apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative eﬃ cacy of antidepressants in individuals with major depression employing a common deﬁ nition of acute response that includes a predeﬁ ned follow-up duration. most trials included in our analysis did not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment, and this might undermine the validity of overall ﬁ ndings. nonetheless, all studies on antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141 evidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interests on medical publications. because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this might be a source of bias. 143 some discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and those in the direct comparisons (escitalopram vs citalopram and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). these ﬁ ndings emphasise a potential advantage of this analysis that incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible sponsorship bias. however, limitations of the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ ndings. readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study publication. 144 such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ ndings. placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately assess the eﬃ cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 in both the usa and europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled studies for marketing authorisation. the selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ cacy is well recognised 146 and there is currently controversy on this topic 147 placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients with a mild form of disease. 148 although placebo-controlled trials can be eﬃ cient because they need smaller sample sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ culties in carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical trials. 149 response to placebo across antidepressant trials has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the fraction of patients responding to active medication as well. 150 the issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed trials. 150 as placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants become increasingly diﬃ cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase iii and also in pragmatic (or eﬀ ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability of the results. although the sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability of the results would, in our opinion, oﬀ set this disadvantage. furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater eﬃ cacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that oﬀ er little to patients other than increased costs. contributors ac, cb, taf, rc, and jrg conceived and designed the meta-analysis, and gs and

inhibitors iproniazid was the first drug defined as an antidepressant; it was later classified as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) [6,7]. several other maois have been introduced since 1957 [8]. due to their irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase, moais have numerous side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and hypertensive crises, that can lead to lethal intracranial hemorrhages. consequently, maois have become less commonly used over time [9]. trials have demonstrated that maois’ efficacy is comparable to that of tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) [10,11]. however, considering maois’ drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and potentially dangerous side effects, they are now almost exclusively prescribed for patients who have not responded to several other pharma- cotherapies, including tcas [9]. furthermore, maois have demonstrated specific efficacy in treating depression with atypical features, such as reactive moods, reverse neuro-vegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection [12]. maois are also a potential therapeutic option when ect is contraindicated [13]. maois’ effectiveness is still unclear for treating depression in patients who are resistant to multiple sequential trials with ssris and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) [14]. nevertheless, psychiatrists’ use of maois has declined over the years [15,16]. the use of maois is generally restricted tokarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9352 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31who do not respond to other treatments. tcas the first tca was discovered and released for clinical use in 1957 under the brand name tofranil [5,17]. since then, tcas have remained among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide [9]. tcas-such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protrip - tyline, imipramine, desipramine, doxepin, and trimipramine-are about as effective as other classes of antidepressants-including ssris, snris, and maois-in treating major depression [18,19]. however, some tcas can be more effective than ssris when used to treat hospit- alized patients [20]. this efficacy can be explained by the superiority of tcas over ssris for patients with severe major depressive disorder (mdd) symptoms who require hospitalization [21-24]. however, no differences have been detected in outpatients who are considered less severely ill[18,20]. in most cases, tcas should generally be reserved for situations when first-line drug treatments have failed [25]. ssris in december 1987, a series of clinical studies confirmed that an ssri called fluoxetine was as effective as tcas for treating depression while causing fewer adverse effects [26]. after being released onto the market, its use expanded more quickly than that of any other psychotropic in history. in 1994, it was the second-best-selling drug in the world [7]. currently available ssris include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. they have elicited different tolerance rates and side effects-mostly sexual and digestive (nausea and loss of appetite), as well as irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches [27]. nevertheless, ssris have a good tolerability profile [28]. in most systematic reviews and meta-analyses, ssris have demonstrated comparable efficacy to tcas [18,19,29], and there is no significant evidence indicating the superiority of any other class or agent over ssris [29-31]. furthermore, studies show no differences in efficacy among individual ssris [29,31-34]. therefore, most guidelines currently recommend ssris as the first-line treatment for patients with major depression [25]. norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors other monoamine (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors called snris emerged during the 1990s to protect patients against the adverse effects of ssris [35]. currently available snris are venlafaxine, desvenla- faxine (the principal metabolite of venlafaxine), and duloxetine. the extended-release form of venlafaxine is the most commonly used drug in this class. clinical guidelines commonly recommend prescribing snri to patients who do not respond to ssris [25]. in individual studies, venlafaxine and duloxetine are generally considered effective as ssris [36]. also, venlafaxine’s efficacy is comparable to that of tcas [37,38]. according to some meta-analyses, reboxetine (a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) seems less efficacious than ssris [39]. however, these findings could be due to the relatively poor tolerance of reboxetine [40]. other antidepressants trazodone is the oldest medication of the so-called “other antidepressants” group that is still in wide use[41,42]. it has been shown to be an effective antidepressant in placebo-controlled research. however, in contemporary practice, it is much more likely to be used in low doses as a sedative-hypnotic than as an antidepressant [41,42]. nefazodone’s structure is analogous to that of trazodone, though it has different pharmacological properties [43]. its efficacy and overall tolerability are comparable to those of ssris, as indicated by comparative trials [43]. however, its use is associated with rare (but fatal) cases of clinical idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity [44]. bupropion’s mechanism of action remains unclear, though it is classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor [45]. it appears to have a more activating profile than ssris that are modestly superior to bupropion in patients with mdd [46]. however, for individuals with low to moderate levels of anxiety, the efficacy of bupropion in treating mdd is comparable to that of ssris [46]. moreover, bupropion has a better tolerability profile than ssris, with minimal weight gain (or even leading to weight loss) [46]. in addition, bupropion is more likely than some ssris to improve symptoms of fatigue and sleepinesskarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9353 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31mirtazapine and mianserin are tetracyclic compounds

bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. the main outcomes were the proportion of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. findings m irtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine (odds ratios [or] 1·39, 1·33, 1·30 and 1·27, respectively), ﬂ uoxetine (1·37, 1·32, 1·28, and 1·25, respectively), ﬂ uvoxamine (1·41, 1·35, 1·30, and 1·27, respectively), paroxetine (1·35, 1·30, 1·27, and 1·22, respectively), and reboxetine (2·03, 1·95, 1·89, and 1·85, respectively). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other antidepressants tested. escitalopram and sertraline showed the best proﬁ le of acceptability, leading to signiﬁ cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine. interpretation clinically important diﬀ erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both eﬃ cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost. funding none. introduction in the past 20 years, several new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of depression, many of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. as with statins for the prevention of coronary events, 1 the extent to which these agents vary in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability is unclear. moreover, some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs 2—ie, chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather than genuine advances in treatment. systematic reviews have already highlighted some diﬀ erences in eﬃ cacy between second-generation antidepressants. 3–9 we report an overview of all randomised controlled trials that compared 12 new-generation antidepressants in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. we used multiple-treat-ments meta-analysis, 10 also known as mixed-treatment comparisons meta-analysis or network meta-analysis, which allows the integration of data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how eﬀ ective they are compared with a common comparator treatment). 11 we aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can be used to guide treatment decisions. methods study selection and data collection at the beginning of this project, we drafted a study protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the public on our institutional website before carrying out the ﬁ nal analyses. furthermore, with the publication of this paper the overall data set will be in the public domain. for our analysis, we included only randomised controlled trials that compared any of the following 12 new-generation antidepressants (bupropion, citalo pram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirta- zapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertra line, and venlafaxine) as monotherapy in the acute-phase treatment of adults with unipolar major depression. we excluded placebo groups where present and

calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: the analysis was based on the total number of randomly assigned participants, irrespective of how the original study investigators analysed the data. to carry out a clinically sound analysis, we used a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming that they did not respond to treatment.first, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies that compared the same interventions with a random-eﬀ ects model 18 to incorporate the assumption that diﬀ erent studies assessed diﬀ erent, yet related, treatment eﬀ ects.17 we used visual inspection of the forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, and the i 2 statistic.19 we did the analyses using stata version 9. second, we did a random-eﬀ ects model within a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo methods in winbugs (mrc biostatistics unit, cambridge, uk). 11 we modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and speciﬁ ed the relations among the odds ratios (ors) across studies making diﬀ erent comparisons. 10 this method combines direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. we used p values less than 0·05 and 95% cis (according to whether the ci included the null value) to assess signiﬁ cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence. 20 we also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most eﬃ cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the or for each drug compared with an arbitrary common control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the markov chain in which each drug had the highest or, the second highest, and so on. we ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods. a key assumption behind multiple-treatments meta- analysis is that the analysed network is coherent—ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. to estimate incoherence, we calculated the ratio of odds ratios for indirect versus direct evidence whenever indirect estimates could be constructed with a single common comparator. we deﬁ ned incoherence as the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% ci excluding 1. finally, we looked at comparative eﬃ cacy among the 12 antidepressant drugs. we expressed these using ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug, because it was the ﬁ rst among these 12 antidepressants to be marketed in europe and the usa, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair-wise comparisons. we did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic range) and imputation (including only studies without imputation). to investigate the eﬀ ect of sponsorship on outcome estimate, we carried out a meta-regression analysis. role of the funding source no drug

network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for eﬃ cacy and 41 for acceptability. we did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that eﬃ cacy favours escitalopram over citalopram; citalopram over reboxetine and paroxetine; mirtazapine over ﬂ uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over ﬂ uoxetine; and venlafaxine over ﬂ uoxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine. these results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two cis would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). for dropouts, ﬂ uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline. overall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons the 95% ci included values that showed very high or no heterogeneity, reﬂ ecting the small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. in the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found i 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine (i2=85·0%), and escitalopram and ﬂ uoxetine (i2=82·7%). in both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.figure 3 summarises the results of the multiple- treatments meta-analysis. escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (even though less clear beneﬁ ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine, with the credibility interval for or slightly more than 1). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other 11 antidepressants. these ﬁ ndings arise from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings might be expected by chance alone. in terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine were less well tolerated than escitalopram and sertraline; ﬂ uvoxamine less well tolerated than citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline; venlafaxine less well tolerated than escitalopram; reboxetine less well tolerated than many other

(paroxetine–citalopram–escitalopram; ﬂ uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– ﬂ uoxetine–bupropion) and three out of 63 comparisons for dropout rate (sertraline–citalopram–escitalopram; ﬂ uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– citalopram–ﬂ uoxetine). these numbers are compatible with chance because about six signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings would be expected out of 133 statistical tests. data extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that diﬀ ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small. exclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the deﬁ ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. the multiple-treatments meta-analysis model was reﬁ tted accordingly and no diﬀ erences in conclusions were observed in either set of ors. figure 4 shows the distribution of probabilities of each treatment being ranked at each of the possible 12 positions. mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were among the most eﬃ cacious treatments, and escitalopram, sertraline, bupropion, and citalopram were better tolerated than the other remaining antidepressants (ﬁ gure 4). the cumulative probabilities of being among the four most eﬃ cacious treatments were: mirtazapine (24·4%), escitalopram (23·7%), venlafaxine

february 28, 2009 753in a meta-regression analysis to assess potential sponsorship bias, ors and ﬁ nal rankings did not substantially change. the cumulative probability of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by the marketing company, with the comparators moving up the ranking slightly. discussion our analysis was based on 117 studies including 25 928 individuals randomly assigned to 12 diﬀ erent new-generation antidepressants. our ﬁ ndings might help to choose among new-generation antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. some antidepressants diﬀ ered both statistically and clinically. in terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. in terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated than other new-generation antidepressants. these results indicate that two of the most eﬃ cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability. here, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as side-eﬀ ects, toxic eﬀ ects, discontinuation symptoms, and social functioning. however, the most important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr aline might be the best choice when starting a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because they have the best possible balance between eﬃ cacy and acceptability. we did not do a formal cost-eﬀ ectiveness analysis; however, because some new anti depressants are now oﬀ patent and available in generic form, their acquisition cost is reduced. indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram and duloxetine) are still on patent in the usa and in europe. sertraline seems to be better than escitalo pram because of its lower cost in most countries. how ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138 reboxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and duloxetine were the least eﬃ cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour able options when prescribing an acute treat ment for major depression. furthermore, in terms of acceptability, reboxetine was the least tolerated agent among the 12 anti depressants and was signiﬁ cantly less eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drugs. therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine ﬁ rst-line acute treatment for major depression. findings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment (8 weeks) of depression. clinicians need to 0·6 0·4 0·2 0probability rank of reboxetine rank of bupropion rank of

(and to what extent) treatments work within a clinically reasonable period. clinically, the assessment of eﬃ cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16–24 weeks or more might lead to wide diﬀ erences in treatment outcome. in many systematic reviews, the ability to provide valid estimates of treatment eﬀ ect is limited because trials with diﬀ erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 a systematic review of clinical-trial data140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common deﬁ nition of early response across all included studies. apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative eﬃ cacy of antidepressants in individuals with major depression employing a common deﬁ nition of acute response that includes a predeﬁ ned follow-up duration. most trials included in our analysis did not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment, and this might undermine the validity of overall ﬁ ndings. nonetheless, all studies on antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141 evidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interests on medical publications. because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this might be a source of bias. 143 some discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and those in the direct comparisons (escitalopram vs citalopram and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). these ﬁ ndings emphasise a potential advantage of this analysis that incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible sponsorship bias. however, limitations of the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ ndings. readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study publication. 144 such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ ndings. placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately assess the eﬃ cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 in both the usa and europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled studies for marketing authorisation. the selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ cacy is well recognised 146 and there is currently controversy on this topic 147 placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients with a mild form of disease. 148 although placebo-controlled trials can be eﬃ cient because they need smaller sample sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ culties in carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical trials. 149 response to placebo across antidepressant trials has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the fraction of patients responding to active medication as well. 150 the issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed trials. 150 as placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants become increasingly diﬃ cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase iii and also in pragmatic (or eﬀ ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability of the results. although the sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability of the results would, in our opinion, oﬀ set this disadvantage. furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater eﬃ cacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that oﬀ er little to patients other than increased costs. contributors ac, cb, taf, rc, and jrg conceived and designed the meta-analysis, and gs and

due to their irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase, moais have numerous side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and hypertensive crises, that can lead to lethal intracranial hemorrhages. consequently, maois have become less commonly used over time [9]. trials have demonstrated that maois’ efficacy is comparable to that of tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) [10,11]. however, considering maois’ drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and potentially dangerous side effects, they are now almost exclusively prescribed for patients who have not responded to several other pharma- cotherapies, including tcas [9]. furthermore, maois have demonstrated specific efficacy in treating depression with atypical features, such as reactive moods, reverse neuro-vegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection [12]. maois are also a potential therapeutic option when ect is contraindicated [13]. maois’ effectiveness is still unclear for treating depression in patients who are resistant to multiple sequential trials with ssris and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) [14]. nevertheless, psychiatrists’ use of maois has declined over the years [15,16]. the use of maois is generally restricted tokarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9352 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31who do not respond to other treatments. tcas the first tca was discovered and released for clinical use in 1957 under the brand name tofranil [5,17]. since then, tcas have remained among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide [9]. tcas-such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protrip - tyline, imipramine, desipramine, doxepin, and trimipramine-are about as effective as other classes of antidepressants-including ssris, snris, and maois-in treating major depression [18,19]. however, some tcas can be more effective than ssris when used to treat hospit- alized patients [20]. this efficacy can be explained by the superiority of tcas over ssris for patients with severe major depressive disorder (mdd) symptoms who require hospitalization [21-24]. however, no differences have been detected in outpatients who are considered less severely ill[18,20]. in most cases, tcas should generally be reserved for situations when first-line drug treatments have failed [25]. ssris in december 1987, a series of clinical studies confirmed that an ssri called fluoxetine was as effective as tcas for treating depression while causing fewer adverse effects [26]. after being released onto the market, its use expanded more quickly than that of any other psychotropic in history. in 1994, it was the second-best-selling drug in the world [7]. currently available ssris include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. they have elicited different tolerance rates and side effects-mostly sexual and digestive (nausea and loss of appetite), as well as irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches [27]. nevertheless, ssris have a good tolerability profile [28]. in most systematic reviews and meta-analyses, ssris have demonstrated comparable efficacy to tcas [18,19,29], and there is no significant evidence indicating the superiority of any other class or agent over ssris [29-31]. furthermore, studies show no differences in efficacy among individual ssris [29,31-34]. therefore, most guidelines currently recommend ssris as the first-line treatment for patients with major depression [25]. norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors other monoamine (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors called snris emerged during the 1990s to protect patients against the adverse effects of ssris [35]. currently available snris are venlafaxine, desvenla- faxine (the principal metabolite of venlafaxine), and duloxetine. the extended-release form of venlafaxine is the most commonly used drug in this class. clinical guidelines commonly recommend prescribing snri to patients who do not respond to ssris [25]. in individual studies, venlafaxine and duloxetine are generally considered effective as ssris [36]. also, venlafaxine’s efficacy is comparable to that of tcas [37,38]. according to some meta-analyses, reboxetine (a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) seems less efficacious than ssris [39]. however, these findings could be due to the relatively poor tolerance of reboxetine [40]. other antidepressants trazodone is the oldest medication of the so-called “other antidepressants” group that is still in wide use[41,42]. it has been shown to be an effective antidepressant in placebo-controlled research. however, in contemporary practice, it is much more likely to be used in low doses as a sedative-hypnotic than as an antidepressant [41,42]. nefazodone’s structure is analogous to that of trazodone, though it has different pharmacological properties [43]. its efficacy and overall tolerability are comparable to those of ssris, as indicated by comparative trials [43]. however, its use is associated with rare (but fatal) cases of clinical idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity [44]. bupropion’s mechanism of action remains unclear, though it is classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor [45]. it appears to have a more activating profile than ssris that are modestly superior to bupropion in patients with mdd [46]. however, for individuals with low to moderate levels of anxiety, the efficacy of bupropion in treating mdd is comparable to that of ssris [46]. moreover, bupropion has a better tolerability profile than ssris, with minimal weight gain (or even leading to weight loss) [46]. in addition, bupropion is more likely than some ssris to improve symptoms of fatigue and sleepinesskarrouri r et al. mdd: validated treatments and future challenges wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9353 november 6, 2021 volume 9 issue 31mirtazapine and mianserin are tetracyclic compounds

bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. the main outcomes were the proportion of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. findings m irtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine (odds ratios [or] 1·39, 1·33, 1·30 and 1·27, respectively), ﬂ uoxetine (1·37, 1·32, 1·28, and 1·25, respectively), ﬂ uvoxamine (1·41, 1·35, 1·30, and 1·27, respectively), paroxetine (1·35, 1·30, 1·27, and 1·22, respectively), and reboxetine (2·03, 1·95, 1·89, and 1·85, respectively). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other antidepressants tested. escitalopram and sertraline showed the best proﬁ le of acceptability, leading to signiﬁ cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine. interpretation clinically important diﬀ erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both eﬃ cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost. funding none. introduction in the past 20 years, several new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of depression, many of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. as with statins for the prevention of coronary events, 1 the extent to which these agents vary in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability is unclear. moreover, some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs 2—ie, chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather than genuine advances in treatment. systematic reviews have already highlighted some diﬀ erences in eﬃ cacy between second-generation antidepressants. 3–9 we report an overview of all randomised controlled trials that compared 12 new-generation antidepressants in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. we used multiple-treat-ments meta-analysis, 10 also known as mixed-treatment comparisons meta-analysis or network meta-analysis, which allows the integration of data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how eﬀ ective they are compared with a common comparator treatment). 11 we aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can be used to guide treatment decisions. methods study selection and data collection at the beginning of this project, we drafted a study protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the public on our

calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: the analysis was based on the total number of randomly assigned participants, irrespective of how the original study investigators analysed the data. to carry out a clinically sound analysis, we used a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming that they did not respond to treatment.first, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies that compared the same interventions with a random-eﬀ ects model 18 to incorporate the assumption that diﬀ erent studies assessed diﬀ erent, yet related, treatment eﬀ ects.17 we used visual inspection of the forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, and the i 2 statistic.19 we did the analyses using stata version 9. second, we did a random-eﬀ ects model within a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo methods in winbugs (mrc biostatistics unit, cambridge, uk). 11 we modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and speciﬁ ed the relations among the odds ratios (ors) across studies making diﬀ erent comparisons. 10 this method combines direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments. we used p values less than 0·05 and 95% cis (according to whether the ci included the null value) to assess signiﬁ cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence. 20 we also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most eﬃ cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the or for each drug compared with an arbitrary common control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the markov chain in which each drug had the highest or, the second highest, and so on. we ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods. a key assumption behind multiple-treatments meta- analysis is that the analysed network is coherent—ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. to estimate incoherence, we calculated the ratio of odds ratios for indirect versus direct evidence whenever indirect estimates could be constructed with a single common comparator. we deﬁ ned incoherence as the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% ci excluding 1. finally, we looked at comparative eﬃ cacy among the 12 antidepressant drugs. we expressed these using ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug, because it was the ﬁ rst among these 12 antidepressants to be marketed in europe and the usa, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair-wise comparisons. we did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic range) and imputation (including only studies without imputation). to investigate the eﬀ ect of sponsorship on outcome estimate, we carried out a meta-regression analysis. role of the funding source no drug

network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for eﬃ cacy and 41 for acceptability. we did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that eﬃ cacy favours escitalopram over citalopram; citalopram over reboxetine and paroxetine; mirtazapine over ﬂ uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over ﬂ uoxetine; and venlafaxine over ﬂ uoxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine. these results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two cis would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). for dropouts, ﬂ uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline. overall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons the 95% ci included values that showed very high or no heterogeneity, reﬂ ecting the small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. in the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found i 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine (i2=85·0%), and escitalopram and ﬂ uoxetine (i2=82·7%). in both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.figure 3 summarises the results of the multiple- treatments meta-analysis. escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (even though less clear beneﬁ ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine and ﬂ uvoxamine, with the credibility interval for or slightly more than 1). reboxetine was signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ cacious than all the other 11 antidepressants. these ﬁ ndings arise from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings might be expected by chance alone. in terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine were less well tolerated than escitalopram and sertraline; ﬂ uvoxamine less well tolerated than citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline; venlafaxine less well tolerated than escitalopram; reboxetine less well tolerated than many other antidepressants, such as bupropion, citalopram, escitalopram, ﬂ uoxetine, and sertraline; and escitalopram and sertraline were better tolerated than duloxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine

uvoxamine–venlafaxine–mirtazapine; and sertraline– citalopram–ﬂ uoxetine). these numbers are compatible with chance because about six signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings would be expected out of 133 statistical tests. data extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that diﬀ ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small. exclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the deﬁ ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. the multiple-treatments meta-analysis

february 28, 2009 753in a meta-regression analysis to assess potential sponsorship bias, ors and ﬁ nal rankings did not substantially change. the cumulative probability of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by the marketing company, with the comparators moving up the ranking slightly. discussion our analysis was based on 117 studies including 25 928 individuals randomly assigned to 12 diﬀ erent new-generation antidepressants. our ﬁ ndings might help to choose among new-generation antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. some antidepressants diﬀ ered both statistically and clinically. in terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were more eﬃ cacious than duloxetine, ﬂ uoxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. in terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated than other new-generation antidepressants. these results indicate that two of the most eﬃ cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability. here, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as side-eﬀ ects, toxic eﬀ ects, discontinuation symptoms, and social functioning. however, the most important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr aline might be the best choice when starting a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because they have the best possible balance between eﬃ cacy and acceptability. we did not do a formal cost-eﬀ ectiveness analysis; however, because some new anti depressants are now oﬀ patent and available in generic form, their acquisition cost is reduced. indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram and duloxetine) are still on patent in the usa and in europe. sertraline seems to be better than escitalo pram because of its lower cost in most countries. how ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138 reboxetine, ﬂ uvoxamine, paroxetine, and duloxetine were the least eﬃ cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour able options when prescribing an acute treat ment for major depression. furthermore, in terms of acceptability, reboxetine was the least tolerated agent among the 12 anti depressants and was signiﬁ cantly less eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drugs. therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine ﬁ rst-line acute treatment for major depression. findings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment (8 weeks) of depression. clinicians need to 0·6 0·4 0·2 0probability rank of reboxetine rank of bupropion rank of

(and to what extent) treatments work within a clinically reasonable period. clinically, the assessment of eﬃ cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16–24 weeks or more might lead to wide diﬀ erences in treatment outcome. in many systematic reviews, the ability to provide valid estimates of treatment eﬀ ect is limited because trials with diﬀ erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 a systematic review of clinical-trial data140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common deﬁ nition of early response across all included studies. apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative eﬃ cacy of antidepressants in individuals with major depression employing a common deﬁ nition of acute response that includes a predeﬁ ned follow-up duration. most trials included in our analysis did not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment, and this might undermine the validity of overall ﬁ ndings. nonetheless, all studies on antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141 evidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interests on medical publications. because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this might be a source of bias. 143 some discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and those in the direct comparisons (escitalopram vs citalopram and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). these ﬁ ndings emphasise a potential advantage of this analysis that incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible sponsorship bias. however, limitations of the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ ndings. readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study publication. 144 such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ ndings. placebo-controlled trials are required to adequately assess the eﬃ cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 in both the usa and europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled studies for marketing authorisation. the selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ cacy is well recognised 146 and there is currently controversy on this topic 147 placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients with a mild form of disease. 148 although placebo-controlled trials can be eﬃ cient because they need smaller sample sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ culties in carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical trials. 149 response to placebo across antidepressant trials has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the fraction of patients responding to active medication as well. 150 the issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed trials. 150 as placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants become increasingly diﬃ cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of eﬃ cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase iii and also in pragmatic (or eﬀ ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability of the results. although the sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability of the results would, in our opinion, oﬀ set this disadvantage. furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater eﬃ cacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that oﬀ er little to patients other than increased costs. contributors ac, cb, taf, rc, and jrg conceived and designed the meta-analysis, and gs and

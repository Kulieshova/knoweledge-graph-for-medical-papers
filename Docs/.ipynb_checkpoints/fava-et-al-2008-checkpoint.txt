(am j psychiatry 2008; 165:342–351) p atients with major depressive disorder often also suf- fer from anxiety, nervousness, and the somatic correlatesof these states (1). in patients with high levels of anxietyaccompanying major depression, greater severity of de-pressive illness and functional impairment (2), greater ill-ness chronicity (3), and an increased risk of suicidality (4)have been reported. although dsm-iv (5) does not recognize anxious de- pression as a diagnostic subtype, emerging evidence sug-gests a number of distinguishing features for this potentialsubtype (2, 3, 6). in outpatients with major depression,earlier studies reported lifetime comorbidity rates of 40%–50% (7, 8) for anxiety disorders. more recently, in two dis-tinct large subsamples of outpatients with major depres-sion in the sequenced treatment alternatives to relievedepression (star*d) project (6, 9), the proportion withanxious depression (those having a baseline 17-itemhamilton rating scale for depression [ham-d] anxiety/somatization factor score ≥7) was in the range of 44%– 46%. in both subsamples, patients with anxious depres-sion were significantly more likely to be unemployed, tohave less education, to be more severely depressed, to have more concurrent anxiety disorders, and to reportmore melancholic/endogenous features, even after ad-justment for severity of depression. previous research has also shown that individuals expe- riencing major depressive disorder with high levels of anx-iety symptoms have a slower response to treatment (10)and, in some (11–13) but not all (4, 14) short-term studies,are less likely than those without high levels of anxioussymptoms to respond to antidepressant treatment, re-gardless of the type of antidepressant used. the associa-tion between anxious depression and poorer response toantidepressant treatment may account for the results of astudy showing that the concomitant use of anxiolytics orsedative/hypnotics was a significant predictor of treat-ment resistance in older adults with depression (15). on the basis of the available literature, we hypothesized that patients with anxious depression would be signifi- cantly less likely than patients with nonanxious depres-sion to respond to, or achieve remission with, antidepres-sant treatment. we tested these hypotheses by examiningam j psychiatry 165:3, march 2008 343fava, rush, alpert, et al. ajp.psychiatryonline.orgtreatment outcomes with antidepressant treatment in pa- tients with anxious versus nonanxious major depressionin levels 1 and 2 of the star*d study. method study overview and organization the rationale, design, and methods of star*d have been de- tailed elsewhere (16, 17). briefly, star*d aimed to determine pro- spectively which of several treatments would be most effective foroutpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who have an unsatisfactory clinical outcome with an initial treatment and, if necessary, subsequent treatment(s). participants were en-rolled at 18 primary care and 23 specialty care settings across the united states. three-quarters of the facilities were privately owned, and about one-third were hospital based. clinical re-search coordinators at each site assisted participants and clini- cians in protocol implementation and collection of clinical mea- sures. a central group of research outcome assessors conductedtelephone interviews to obtain primary outcome measure data. study population prior to study entry, all risks, benefits, and potential adverse events associated with participation in the study were explainedto participants, who provided written informed consent in a pro- tocol approved by institutional review boards. to enhance the generalizability of findings, study eligibility was limited to self-declared outpatients (no symptomatic volunteers)seeking treatment and identified by their clinicians as having ma- jor depressive disorder requiring treatment. advertising for symptomatic volunteers was proscribed. broadly inclusive selec-tion criteria were used (16, 17). for eligibility, patients had to be 18–75 years of age, meet dsm-iv criteria for single or recurrent nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (established by treatingclinicians and confirmed by a dsm-iv checklist), have a score ≥14 (indicating moderate severity) on the 17-item ham-d (18) as rated by a clinical research coordinator, and not have been treat-ment resistant in an adequate trial of an antidepressant during the current episode. exclusion criteria have been described else- where (16, 17). definition of anxious depression as in our previous studies (6, 9, 19), anxious depression was de- fined as major depressive disorder with high levels of anxiety symptoms, as reflected in a ham-d anxiety/somatization factorscore ≥7. the anxiety/somatization factor, derived from cleary and guy’ s (20) factor analysis of the ham-d scale, includes six items from the original 17-item version: the items for psychicanxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight. we used the baseline ham-d score (obtained by research outcomeassessors) to assess for the presence of anxious depression. baseline measures at baseline, clinical research coordinators collected standard demographic information, self-reported psychiatric history, andcurrent general medical conditions as evaluated by the cumula- tive illness rating scale (21). they administered the ham-d and assessed depressive symptoms using the clinician-rated 16-itemquick inventory of depressive symptomatology (qids-c); pa- tients completed the self-report version of the qids (qids-sr) (22–25). patients also comple ted the psychiatric diagnostic screening questionnaire (26, 27), which is used to assess for the presence of 11 potential concurrent dsm-iv disorders. based on prior reports (26), we used thresholds with a 90% specificity in re-lation to the gold-standard diagnosis rendered by a structured in-terview to define the presence of concomitant axis i disorders. current general medical conditions were assessed by the 14-item cumulative illness rating scale (21, 28); for this instrument, a manual (29) was used to guide scoring. the research outcome assessors, blind to treatments and work- ing from locations separate from clinical sites, conducted telephone interviews to complete the ham-d and the 30-item clinician-ratingversion of the inventory of depressive symptomatology (23, 30). responses to items on these measures were used to estimate the presence of atypical (31), melancholic (32), and anxious (6) symp-tom features. an interactive voice response system (33) was used to collect data from patients on their health perceptions (with the 12-item short form health survey [34]), quality of life (with the quality oflife enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire [35]), and occupa- tional and interpersonal adjustment (with the work and social adjustment scale [36]). course of treatment measures an integral part of our measurement-based care intervention (37) was the collection, at each visit, of clinically relevant infor-mation to inform treatment decision making. at each clinic visit, the qids-c and qids-sr ratings were obtained, and side effects were assessed using three 7-point scales to rate their frequency,intensity, and global burden (17, 38). intervention the aim of citalopram treatment in level 1 was to achieve symptom remission, which was defined as qids-c score ≤5. the protocol (17) required a fully adequate dose of citalopram for a sufficient time to maximize the likelihood of achieving remission,so those who did not achieve remission were truly resistant to the medication. dose adjustments were guided by recommendations in a treatment manual (www.star-d.org) that allowed individualizedstarting doses and dose adjustments to minimize side effects, maximize safety, and optimize the chances of therapeutic benefit for each patient. citalopram was to begin at 20 mg/day and beraised to 40 mg/day by weeks 2–4 and to 60 mg/day (final dose) by weeks 4–6. dose adjustments were guided by how long a pa- tient had received a particular dose, symptom changes, and sideeffect burden.figure 1. distribution of ham-d anxiety/somatization factor scores in patients treated with

2008anxious and nonanxious depression in star*d ajp.psychiatryonline.orgthe protocol recommended treatment visits at 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 weeks, with an optional visit at week 14 if needed. after an op- timal trial of citalopram (based on dose and duration), patientswhose symptoms responded or remitted could enter the 12-month naturalistic follow-up phase, but all who did not achieveremission were encouraged to enter the next randomized trial inthe star*d sequence (level 2). patients could discontinue citalo-pram before 12 weeks if intolerable side effects made a medica-tion change necessary, if an optimal dose increase was not possi-ble because of side effects or patient choice, or if significantsymptoms (as indicated by a qids-c score ≥9) were present after 9 weeks at maximally tolerated doses. patients could opt to move to the next treatment level if they had intolerable side effects or iftheir qids-c score was >5 after a trial of adequate dosage and du- ration. a treatment manual, initial didactic instruction, ongoingsupport and guidance by the clinical research coordinator, theuse of a structured evaluation of depressive symptoms and sideeffects at each visit, and a centralized treatment monitoring andfeedback system together represented an intensive effort to pro-vide consistent, high-quality care (37; see also www.star-d.org). safety assessments to monitor side effects and serious adverse events, a multi- tiered approach (39) was used, involving the clinical research co-ordinators, the study clinicians, the interactive voice responsesystem, the clinical manager, safety officers, regional center di-rectors, and the national institute of mental health’ s data safety and monitoring board. concomitant medications concomitant treatments for current general medical condi- tions, for associated symptoms of depression (e.g., sleep and agi-tation), and for citalopram’ s side effects were permitted, based onclinical judgment, at study entry or during the treatments. main outcome measures the primary outcome measure was the ham-d score, ob- tained by research outcome assessors using telephone-basedstructured interviews at entry and exit from citalopram treat-ment. secondary outcome measures included the qids-sr and the rating scale for frequency, intensity, and burden of side effects at baseline and at each treatment visit.statistical analysis remission was defined as an exit ham-d score ≤7 or last ob- served qids-sr score ≤5. as defined in the original study pro- posal, patients for whom the exit ham-d score was missing were designated as not achieving remission. response was defined asa reduction of ≥50% from baseline in the qids-sr score at the last assessment. intolerance was defined a priori as either leav- ing treatment before 4 weeks or leaving at or after 4 weeks withintolerance as the identified reason. the alpha level in analyses was set at 0.05 (two-sided). no adjustments were made for multi- ple comparisons. baseline clinical and demographic features, treatment fea- tures, and rates of side effects and serious adverse events were compared between patients with anxious and nonanxious de- pression. student’ s t tests and mann-whitney u tests were usedfor continuous variables, and chi-square tests were used for dis- crete variables. logistic regression models were used to compare remission and response rates after adjustment for baseline severity of de- pression (as measured by the qids-sr) and regional center. bi- variate logistic regression models were used to examine the asso-ciation of remission rates (using both the ham-d and the qids- sr criteria) with several independent variables: presence of anx- ious depression; total score on the ham-d anxiety/somatizationfactor; total score on the ham-d psychic and somatic anxiety items; and presence of any comorbid anxiety disorder. cross-tabulations of remission (as measured by either the ham-d or the qids-sr criteria) with each possible threshold onthe ham-d anxiety/somatization factor were obtained, and the sensitivity and specificity at each threshold were calculated and graphed. we also plotted the number of anxiety symptoms based on the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor versus the percentage of pa- tients who achieved remission according to either the ham-d or the qids-sr criteria. time to first remission (with remission defined as a qids-sr score ≤5) and time to first response ( ≥50% reduction from base- line qids-sr score) were defined as the first observed point inclinic visit data. log-rank tests were used to compare the cumula- tive proportions of patients with and without anxious depression whose symptoms remitted or responded. we ran logistic regression models with remission (based on the ham-d or qids-sr cutoffs) in level 2 as the outcome and withtable 1. treatment characteristics of patients in level 1 of star*d, by presence of anxious depression dose and

assessors) and who re-turned for at least one postbaseline visit in level 1 ofstar*d (see supplementary table 1 in the data supple-ment that accompanies the online version of this article).data on this subsample, which showed significant clinicaland sociodemographic differences from those excluded,have been reported previously (37). figure 1 summarizesthe distribution of ham-d anxiety/somatization factorscores for the analyzable sample. sociodemographic and clinical features at baseline as in our two previous studies (6, 9), anxious depression was significantly more common than nonanxious depres-sion among african americans than in other racial/ethnicgroups; among hispanics than non-hispanics; amongthose seen in primary care settings than those in psychiat-ric care settings; among those who were unemployed thanthose who were employed; among those who were mar-ried, divorced, or widowed than among those who hadnever married; and among those with less education,those with public insurance, and those with lesser income.patients with more severe depression at baseline (as mea-sured by the qids-sr and the clinician-rating version ofthe inventory of depressive symptomatology), greaterperceived physical impairment (as measured by the shortform health survey), more diminished quality of life, andlater onset of major depression were also significantlymore likely to have anxious depression. in addition, anx-ious depression was associated with a greater likelihood ofreporting suicidal ideation on the ham-d, a personal his- tory of attempted suicide, and a family history of drugabuse. finally , patients with anxious depression were sig-nificantly more likely than those with nonanxious depres-sion to report melancholic or atypical symptom featuresand to have more medical comorbidity (as measured bythe cumulative illness rating scale scores). as for concur- rent psychiatric comorbidity, individuals with anxiousmajor depressive disorder were more likely to meet psy-chiatric diagnostic screening questionnaire criteria forgeneralized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social pho-bia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stressdisorder, agoraphobia, hypochondriasis, and somatoformdisorder and to have a greater overall number of comorbidaxis i conditions. treatment characteristics in level 1, by anxious versus nonanxious depression patients with anxious depression made fewer visits and spent less time in treatment than those without anxiousdepression (table 1). moreover, although the average cit-alopram dosage did not differ, time on the final dosagewas shorter in the anxious than in the nonanxious depres-sion group. outcomes in level 1, by anxious versus nonanxious depression as shown in table 2, remission rates were significantly lower in patients with anxious depression, according toboth the ham-d criterion (22.2% versus 33.4%) and theqids-sr criterion (27.5% versus 38.9%). response rateswere also significantly lower for patients with anxious de-pression (41.7% versus 52.8%). these differences re-mained significant even after adjustment for severity ofdepression at baseline and for regional center. in addition,the anxious depression group had significantly highermean qids-sr scores at exit and significantly lower rawqids-sr change scores and percentage change in qids-table

also remained significant after adjustment forseverity of depression at baseline and for regional center. table 3 summarizes the results of the logistic regression models assessing the association between the presence ofanxiety and/or anxious depression and remission. all thepredictors were consistently and significantly related toremission status at endpoint. for both endpoints—remis-sion as defined by the ham-d and by the qids-sr—thetotal score of the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor wasthe best predictor (average r 2=0.020), followed closely by the total score of the ham-d psychic and somatic anxietyitems (average r 2=0.016), and then by whether anxious depression was present (average r2=0.015) and whether any comorbid anxiety disorders were present (averager 2=0.014). patients with anxious depression had a greater reduc- tion in anxiety/somatization scores than those withnonanxious depression, but they also had greater residualsymptoms of anxiety/somatization at endpoint than thosewithout anxious depression (see supplementary table 2 inthe online supplement). we examined the sensitivity versus specificity obtained as a result of the cross-tabulations of remission (definedwith either the ham-d or the qids-sr) with each possiblethreshold on the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor (seesupplementary figures 1 and 2 in the online supplement).from these analyses, it appears that the specificity dropsoff quickly. we also plotted the number of anxiety symptoms ac- cording to the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor versusthe percentage of patients achieving remission as definedby either the ham-d or the qids-sr criterion (see figure2; see also supplementary figure 3 in the online supple- ment). in general, one can observe a downward trend, with the remission rate dropping as the number of anxiety symptoms increases. tolerability and side effects in level 1, by anxious versus nonanxious depression despite similar citalopram dosages in the two groups and the longer treatment exposure in the nonanxious de- pression group (table 1), the anxious depression group had greater a frequency, intensity, and burden of side ef- fects than the nonanxious depression group, as well as more serious adverse events (table 4). notably, the num- ber of hospitalizations for ge neral medical conditions was strikingly different between the two groups: 40 among the patients with anxious depression compared with 18 among those with nonanxious depression. time to remission or response in level 1, by anxious versus nonanxious depression the time to first remission (figure 3) and first response (figure 4) differed significantly between the anxious and nonanxious depression groups: those with nonanxious depression achieved remission and response sooner on average than those with anxious depression. sample description of level 2 study participants in level 2 of star*d, 1,292 adult outpatients with major depressive disorder who had no remission of symptoms in level 1 or could not tolerate citalopram (in the case of theswitch option only) were randomly assigned either to switch (overall n=727) to sustained-release bupropion (at a maximal daily dose of 400 mg; n=239), sertraline (at a maximal daily dose of 200 mg; n=238), or extended-re- lease venlafaxine (at a maximal daily dose of 375 mg; n=250) or to continue taking citalopram and receive aug- mentation (overall n=565) with sustained-release bupro- pion (at a dose of up to 400 mg per day; n=279) or bus- pirone (at a dose of up to 60 mg per day; n=286). the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of this level 2 sample have been previously reported (40, 41).figure 2. ham-d anxiety/somatization factor score versus percent remission in 2,876 patients in level 1 of star*d

intolevel 2. those with anxious depression fared significantlyworse in both the switching and augmentation options.the logistic regression analyses did not indicate a moder-ating effect of anxiety (anxiety and treatment interactionindicating that a certain treatment works better or worsein those with anxious depression). discussion this is the largest sample used thus far to examine whether major depression with anxious features is associ-ated with a different treatment outcome than nonanxiousmajor depression. consistent with much of the literature (10–13), we found in level 1 of star*d that patients withanxious depression were less likely to respond or to remitwith citalopram treatment than those with nonanxiousdepression. overall, they also took longer to remit. this as-sociation between anxious depression and poorer treat-ment outcomes with citalopram held true regardless ofhow we defined anxious depression. results of all the lo-gistic regression models we used to assess this associationshowed that the average r 2 values ranged from 0.014 to 0.020, with the total score of the ham-d anxiety/somati-zation factor being the best predictor, followed closely bythe total score of the ham-d psychic and somatic anxietyitems, and then by whether anxious depression was present (as defined by a ham-d anxiety/somatization fac-tor score ≥7); the worst predictor was whether any concur- rent anxiety disorders were present. although these data and the relatively linear decline in remission rates with in- creasing anxiety factor scores (figure 2) may seem to sug- gest that the anxious/somatic factor should be viewedmore as a continuous dimension than a dichotomous sub-type, one might argue that there is a certain clinical utilityin the use of a threshold value and that the dichotomy per-formed well enough in our regression analyses. in level 2 of star*d, patients with anxious depression were also less likely than those with nonanxious depres-sion to achieve remission, regardless of whether theirlevel 2 treatment was a switch option or an augmentationoption. this is the first time that a predictor of poorer out-come with antidepressant treatment in a population with- out any prior history of treatment resistance has been confirmed in a population with prospectively defined re-sistance or intolerance to antidepressant treatment. the lower ham-d remission rates observed in the anx- ious depression group could be due in part to residualsymptoms of anxiety, which may have increased the ham- d score, since this scale comprises several anxiety symp- tom items. on the other hand, lower remission rates foranxious depression in both levels 1 and 2 of star*d werealso observed with the qids-sr, which measures onlycore symptoms of major depression and does not includeany items measuring anxiety symptoms.table 4. side effects and adverse events in patients in level 1 of star*d, by presence of anxious depression measureanxious

2008anxious and nonanxious depression in star*d ajp.psychiatryonline.orgside effect frequency, intensity, and burden in level 1 were greater among patients with anxious depression thanamong those with nonanxious depression, as were seriousadverse events, including those of a psychiatric nature. inaddition, both time in treatment and time on the final cit-alopram dosage were significantly lower in the anxiousthan in the nonanxious depression group, although thesedifferences were small. perhaps patients whose illness in-cluded anxious features were more sensitive to somaticchanges occurring during antidepressant treatment, andthey may have been more likely to drop out on encounter-ing side effects. these adverse event findings are interest-ing, as they suggest that this difference may reflect physicalvulnerability rather than a difference in the interpretationof discomfort. these findings, taken together with our two previous star*d reports on anxious depression (6, 9), have severalpractical implications for the recognition and diagnosis ofanxious depression. the presence of certain clinical andsociodemographic characteristics should alert us to thepossibility that anxiety may be a prominent feature of apatient’s major depressive disorder. as recommended byrobins and guze (42) and later expanded on by kendler(43), a distinct psychiatric diagnostic entity may be con-sidered valid if it can be shown to have differentiating fea-tures, evidence of familiality, specific treatment responsiv-ity, and a unique course. in this and our two previousstudies (6, 9), anxious depression appeared to be associ-ated with a characteristic clinical profile, independent ofseverity of depression. as for familiality, we did not obtainany family history of anxious depression, so we could not assess whether this subtype of depression runs in families.our results are consistent with the view that anxious de-pression is associated with specific treatment responsivity,in that patients with this subtype were less likely to achieve remission than those with nonanxious depression after antidepressant treatment, in both levels 1 and 2 ofstar*d, regardless of treatment assignment in level 2. al-though more data are needed to provide information onthe specific treatment responsivity and on the familialityof this condition, the findings of this study, combined withthose of our previous studies, are supportive of the viewthat anxious depression might be a valid diagnostic sub-type of major depressive disorder. our results also suggestthe need for additional emphasis on the measurement ofsymptoms of anxiety during the acute management ofpatients with major depression, particularly those whosesymptoms are resolving only slowly and those who con-tinue to exhibit residual symptoms after an adequate anti-depressant trial (44). this study had several limitations that should be taken into account in interpreting the results and recommenda- tions. our definition of anxious depression was based onthe severity of anxiety symptoms as measured by the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor. although the ham-d doesinclude anxiety items and its anxiety/somatization factorhas been used in a number of previous studies, it captures only a limited number of anxiety symptoms. therefore, the possibility of a significant risk of misclassification cannotfigure 3. time to remission in 2,876 patients in level 1 of star*d, by anxious versus nonanxious depressiona alog-rank statistic=41.7, p<0.0001.0.0 2 4 6 9 12 14 00.20.40.60.81.01,345 1,269

out. on the other hand, the association between anxious depression and poorer treatment outcome withantidepressant monotherapy in level 1 of star*d held trueregardless of how we defined anxious depression. anotherlimitation is that we did not use a clinician-administeredstructured diagnostic interview, which might have provideda more accurate diagnostic picture. also, since only outpa-tients with major depression were enrolled in the study, theclinical correlates and symptom patterns we found to be as-sociated with anxious depression may be different in inpa-tients treated for depression. furthermore, in the absenceof a placebo control, we cannot determine whether thesepatients are specifically less responsive to true drug effectsor less responsive to the nonspecific aspects of treatment.in addition, participants were enrolled from a number ofsites in a nonrandom manner. finally, patients with anxiousdepression had a higher physic al illness burden, lower so- cioeconomic status, greater severity of depression, andlater onset of depression, all of which could themselves beassociated with poorer treatment outcome. it is possiblethat more severe or more difficult-to-treat forms of depres-sion are accompanied by high levels of anxiety and there-fore that high levels of anxiety in depression are simply anepiphenomenon of these other forms of depression and donot represent a different subtype. similarly, it is possiblethat the greater side effect burden in the group with highlevels of anxiety could be explained by the greater numberof general medical conditions in this group. received nov. 16, 2006; revisions received march 20, june 18, and aug. 20, 2007; accepted aug. 27, 2007 (doi: 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06111868). from the depression clinical

with the following chief complaint: “i am very nervous, stressed out, and i cry a lot.” she also reported poor sleep, frequent awakenings, diminished appetite, excessive worrying, headaches and muscle aches, feelings of worthlessness and pessimism, inability to enjoy things, psychomotor agitation, and restlessness. she endorsed some feelings of hopelessness but denied having thoughts of death or suicide. ms. d had a history of generalized anxiety since childhood, but this was appar-ently her ﬁrst episode of major depression. she denied any history of alcohol or drug abuse and said that occasional use of nicotine made her “more nervous.” ms. d was started on a course of antidepressant therapy with citalopram. within a few days of starting the medication, she called us expressing her concerns about the side effects that she was experiencing; in particular, she was worried about the worsening of her insomnia and her nervousness. she also reported a number of physical symptoms, including dryness of mouth and constipation. ms. d’s anxiety escalated over the next few days, and a benzodiazepine was prescribed, which brought about a signiﬁcant improvement in her insomnia and agitation. ms. d continued to report a number of physical symptoms throughout the ﬁrst 4 weeks of treatment, but she was able to remain on citalopram. after 6 weeks of combined treatment with citalopram and a benzodiazepine, ms. d reported a signiﬁcant improvement in all her symptoms, and remission was achieved at the end of the 10th week of treatment. when the benzodiazepine dosage was decreased soon after remission had been achieved, ms. d reported a reemergence of her insomnia and agitation. she and her physician agreed that she would maintain the treatment combination for at least 6 months. ms. d did so and maintained her remission throughout the continuation phase of350 am j psychiatry 165:3, march 2008anxious and nonanxious depression in star*d
